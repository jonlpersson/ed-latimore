        #### I tried to quit smoking weed for years before working with Ed.

        The real wake-up call was when I realized that I've been going through the cycle of waking up full of regret every morning, telling myself I was going to quit, and then smoking up again that night since I was 17. I'm 27 now. The inner conflict was killing me.

        This habit caused my health to suffer as well as my self-respect. Not to mention I was struggling financially for years as well, which was undeniably a result of my bad habits.

        Vicebreakers—and Ed—have been a godsend.

        #### For over 18 months I tried to eliminate bad habits from my life...

        I figured I could because I'd always done my self-improvement alone, I could handle this alone too. But I was struggling hard...

        So when I saw Ed had created something to help break bad habits and get on a better track in life, I decided to swallow my pride and see if it would help me too.

        That was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I've now left every destructive vice of mine behind. I'm happier, healthier, and more fulfilled than ever. I wouldn't have been able to do it alone.

        ## In Vicebreakers, you'll finally learn:

        - The #1 requirement to quit any bad habit *(Without this, the task is hopeless)*
        - How to push through any withdrawals and get back on your feet as fast as possible *(Most people never get past the withdrawal stage because the pains push them right back to their preferred choice of comfort)*
        - How to shift your perception to make your vices seem repulsive *(And never crave them again… seriously, this trick is magic)*
        - How to identify the emotional and environmental triggers that make you want to indulge in your vice *(When you become aware of them, you can build systems and guardrails around them to make using close to impossible)*
        - How your brain’s reward system works and the evolutionary reasons why you can’t overpower your addiction *(You’re not weak. You’re just working against millions of years of genetic hardwiring)*
        - How to systematically build good habits in lieu of your bad habits to ensure that your goals quickly become reality *(Your brain demands certain feel-good neurochemicals. You’ll learn how to get them naturally without indulging in your vices)*
        - How to have fun and make friends without the aid of your vice *(Your environment is usually stronger, but this is your secret weapon)*

        And many other valuable pieces of formation and insights that will allow you to finally kick your bad habits and build some good ones instead.

        The real reason you couldn’t kick your bad habits before had nothing to do with genetics, a lack of willpower, or your childhood.

        You just didn’t have an effective process. But now with Vice Breakers, you finally have reliable, clear, and most importantly, simple way to make progress.

        My system is based on science and experience.

        It relies on actionable strategies I and others have used to eliminate our worst habits.

        #### I've been looking for a course like this for a long time.

        I see myself as a pretty healthy person overall, but there always seems to be one or two things that I fall back on that I know I need to quit.

        Vicebreakers was the program I needed to wrap my head around *why* I kept falling back into these old patterns and how I could safely substitute other habits in their place.

        It's all laid out clearly and I found myself continuously having 'a-ha!' moments as I read through it all. Ed Latimore helped me to see the big picture clearly and simply. Once you've broken everything down, it's easy to understand.

        ## This is the course I wish I had when I was neck deep in addiction and wallowing in self-pity

        *My personal breaking point: a short story.*

        It was obvious when I needed to give up drinking…

        But it took another two years of crippling hangovers and pissing off friends and loved ones before I finally gathered the courage and resolve to quit.

        I also struggled with porn addiction for many years and could never get a handle on it (pun intended).

        For years, I wasted my life and potential away in a numb fog.

        Finally, after yet another embarrassing night, I’d had enough. I realized that I hated this version of myself…

        I was tired of being broke, going nowhere fast, and not being able to stand the face I saw in the mirror.

        *I wanted to be respected and admired.*

        *I wanted to be clean and healthy.*

        *I wanted to earn money and accomplish something noteworthy in my life.*

        So I got my problems under control and made real progress towards these three goals.

        There is not a single area of my life that didn’t improve when I stopped drinking or watching porn.

        In the 7 years since then, I have:

        - Cultivated a 7-year long relationship
        - Finished college
        - Served in the military
        - Written two Amazon best-selling books
        - Built an online audience of over 135,000 followers
        - Boxed professionally
        - Generated a 6-figure, location independent income
        - Learned another language
        - Moved abroad

        And much more.

        I want you to experience your own marvelous transformation like I did, because I know firsthand the suffering that comes from being held hostage by self-destructive habits.

        And I know how *amazing* it feels to come out the other side.

        #### In the summer of 2020 I got busted.

        It wasn't the first time. It will be the last. I'm talking about watching porn.

        I connected with Vicebreakers at the end of August. By following Ed's advice, I have successfully abstained from using porn and fapping.

        A couple months in I knew it was also time to kick my nicotine habit. By applying the same tools I have been able to stay nicotine-free. Vicebreakers changed my life. If you have habits that you are no longer benefiting from, give these guys a try. I'm glad I did.

        - Living with low energy and no motivation
        - Blowing opportunity after opportunity because you aren’t at 100%
        - Not being the man or woman you could be for your family
        - Threatening your very safety through irresponsible indulgence and reckless behavior

        It’s time for a change, and with Vicebreakers, change is not only possible… it’s guaranteed. A 30-day money-back guarantee is included with your purchase.

        See you inside.

        Yours,<br>
        Ed Latimore.
