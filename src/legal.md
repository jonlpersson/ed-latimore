## Affiliate Disclaimer

Hi. Ed Latimore here. This page is here to protect my ass and my money. I’ve included certain products and links to those products on this site that pay out an affiliate commission for any purchases you make using those links.

My goal with the blog is to help you live a better life and learn from my mistakes, but I have bills to pay. I don’t think I’m bad at writing (or at least I am improving tremendously), but being good by itself doesn’t keep my fridge full. Selling stuff through affiliate links does. It’s a nice, non-intrusive, helpful way to monetize my site.

My site has grown to the point that it’s nearly impossible to go back through and list each and every program that I have an affiliate agreement with. Given this, you should assume that any links leading you to products or services are affiliate links that I will receive compensation from.

That being said, I only promote those products or services that I have used and truly feel deliver value to you. Examples would include any Amazon products I promote or the Wim Hof Method course.

EdLatimore.com is also a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

Please note that I have not been given any free products, services or anything else by these companies in exchange for mentioning them on the site. The only consideration is in the form of affiliate. I’m on no one’s payroll and they probably don’t care if I shut up shop tomorrow. I don’t make THAT much money from affiliates.

If you have any questions regarding the above, please do not hesitate to contact me by using the contact page. It can be accessed in the site footer below.
