Pornography has become increasingly accessible and prevalent in today's digital age.&nbsp;

Porn today is not like what it was when I was growing up. I'm born in 1985, which means that for most of my childhood, the internet didn't even exist. And even when it finally started making its way into our homes, it wasn't the hi-speed, hand-held, wireless behemoth it is today.

Because it's so easy to access and there is so much variety, it's become addictive to the point where 12-step programs are popping up to help guys stop watching porn.

For many, what starts as a casual indulgence or curiosity can turn into a harmful addiction. Especially if you start watching porn as a young man, which is happening more and this technological access is available for everyone.&nbsp;

If you're looking to stop watching porn and regain control of your life, you're in the right place. This short but comprehensive guide will teach you effective strategies that I've used to help guys overcome porn addiction and replace it with healthier habits.

## 9 strategies to help you stop watching porn

## 1\. Acknowledge your problem with watching adult content

The first step to overcoming porn addiction is admitting you have a problem. By acknowledging the issue, you can begin to address its root causes and seek the necessary support to create lasting change.

If you aren’t willing to admit that something is wrong, you’ll never be able to fix it. You know if you have a problem watching porn. Even if you’re having fun, deep down, a part of you hates the fact that you’re a slave to digital images you’ll never interact with.

You hate that every day, you have intrusive thoughts about masturbating to women you’ll never meet. You’re ashamed you bought a subscription to some random chick’s Only Fans account.

That’s ok. The journey of 1000 days clean begins with day one and a little self-discipline.

## 2\. Identify what triggers you to watch porn

Recognize the situations, emotions, or locations that lead to porn consumption. Identifying these triggers will help you develop strategies to avoid or cope with them in healthy ways.

You know the stressors that make you more likely to watch porn. Some guys use porn to deal with loneliness. For others, it’s part of the nightly ritual of playing video games and smoking weed. And for others still, it’s a coping mechanism for their failures in life.

While it’s true that many guys get so hooked on internet porn that they’re always thinking about it, many aren’t like this. Instead, there is always some inciting incident or ritual that leads them to visit their favorite sites.

Take the time to get clear on why you watch porn so that you can, at the very least, avoid the things that weaken your willpower and makes it easy for you to resort to porn.

## 3\. Set clear goals to end pornography dependence

Determine specific, achievable goals to stop watching porn. Break them down into smaller, manageable steps, and establish a timeline for reaching these objectives. Monitor your progress and celebrate your successes along the way.

When the goal is small, it’s easier to manage and easier to reach. While everyone says that you need to accomplish difficult goals, sometimes you just need to get a few quick successes under your belt to motivate you to keep going.

So our objective is to have clear, small goals. For example, to go 72 hours without watching porn might be a small goal for some and a huge goal for others. Find your small goal and knock it out. In this way, you’ll develop the confidence necessary to tackle bigger goals and get your porn habit under more control.

## 4\. Establish healthy habits for avoiding explicit material

Replace the time spent on porn with healthier activities that promote personal growth, such as exercise, meditation, hobbies, or volunteering. Engaging in these positive behaviors will help you build self-esteem and reduce the urge to watch porn.

You need a hobby that gets you away from a screen and develops you as a person. Video games, for example, are a terrible hobby. Take up things like combat sports, weight lifting, or hiking. If you aren’t overly physical, take up chess, poker, or learn a foreign language.

It’s even better if your hobby forces you to interact with different people. That’s how real change happens and progress is made in the face of porn addiction, because porn addiction is a lonely disease. Unlike drugs and alcohol, there is no social ritual to get addicted to. Socializing with other people builds a protective barrier between you and pornography.

## 5\. Limit exposure to what triggers you to watch porn

Eliminate or reduce exposure to triggers that lead to porn consumption. This may involve installing content filters on your devices, deleting bookmarks or accounts, and avoiding websites or social media platforms where you'll likely encounter pornographic content.

This is where using porn blockers and building good habits comes into play. Many porn blockers have features that make it easy for you to find an accountability partner as well. It’s easy to break bad habits when you know that you’ll have to answer to someone.

If you’re tired of being a slave to porn sites, read my article about the best porn blockers to help you quit porn. I personally recommend Covenant Eyes, but I also cover many other popular pieces of software that do a decent job keeping you from viewing porn.

## 6\. Don't be afraid to seek outside help

You don't have to fight this battle alone. Seek support from friends, family, or support groups. Sharing your experiences and struggles with others can provide valuable insights and encouragement.

This is also why having an accountability partner makes a big difference. Just having someone to talk to when you think that you’re about to give in can make it much easier to kick your porn habit.

Another benefit of support is that you have someone to check in on you. Sometimes our friends and loved ones are too close to us to feel comfortable going to them to discuss our issues. This is where support groups can really make a difference.

Especially if you don’t want anyone to know about your pornography addiction or you don’t have anyone who cares about your well-being in the first place.

## 7\. Consider professional help

If you're struggling to stop watching porn alone, consider seeing a mental health professional. A therapist or counselor specializing in addiction recovery can provide tailored guidance and support to help you overcome your addiction.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and sex addiction counseling can make a huge difference in cutting back on your porn use. There are even 12-step programs modeled off of alcoholics anonymous to help you curb your porn use and get your sexual behavior in order.

Remember: the goal isn’t to be perfect. It’s merely to get better.

## 8\. Have more real sex&nbsp;

You only have so much energy. I’ve read many articles that claim to teach you how to stop watching porn, but none suggest meeting more women in real life. I know that many guys develop a porn addiction because they’re tired of being rejected. This tells me that one of the fastest solutions is to stop getting rejected and start having a sex life.

I’m not claiming that this is easy. In fact, I know it’s a lot easier to blow your load to an infinite variety of digital women that meet one in real life, but real sex is better for you than fake sex. And getting laid for real will cut dramatically decrease your pornography use.

## 9\. Let the negative consequences of porn addiction scare you

Watching online porn has a host of negative impacts on your mental and physical well-being. It helps to remember them as a method to scare yourself out of wanting to watch porn. Don’t forget that you’ll likely suffer from the following:

* Erectile dysfunction
* General sexual dysfunction
* Need for more extreme stimuli to get aroused
* Lack of sexual satisfaction from real life sexual relationships
* Dopamine depletion
* [Viscious withdrawal symptoms](/dealing-with-porn-addiction-withdrawal/)

## Final word about these strategies for escaping porn addiction

Overcoming porn addiction and stopping the habit of watching porn requires dedication, self-awareness, and persistence. By following these strategies and seeking support from others, you can regain control of your life and experience lasting change.

Remember, the journey may be challenging, but the rewards of a porn-free life are well worth the effort.
