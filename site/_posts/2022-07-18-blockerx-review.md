Let’s be honest; online porn is everywhere. Even when you’re not searching for it, there’s a decent chance you’ll find an explicit image or video pop up while browsing Twitter, Reddit, or a message board. A considerable chunk of the internet is devoted to porn and porn sites, and it’s no surprise that [viewership among adults and minors is rising](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/process-addiction/porn-addiction/pornography-statistics/).

The easy access to porn has enabled a generation of men to become porn addicts, making treatment challenging. Although it’s becoming increasingly evident that porn addiction can [interfere with your life and ruin relationships](/reasons-porn-is-harmful/), the social stigma of admitting addiction can make it difficult to speak out or seek treatment.

Thankfully, other options exist to help guys break one of the most isolating and under-discussed addictions. One of the best options is using a tool called a porn blocker that keeps you from accessing porn in the first place and offers accountability to keep you on track.

A popular tool that offers both of these features is BlockerX, and its app can help you beat addiction and stop procrastinating.


## What is BlockerX?

BlockerX is a VPN-based porn-blocking and accountability software that lets you browse the web safely and without distractions by blocking ads, porn sites, gambling sites, social media, and even video games. It also offers a safe search feature by blocking an exhaustive list of adult keywords from appearing in search results.

BlockerX is compatible with iOS and Android via its app and also offers a Chrome browser extension that works across all major operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The Chrome extension starts working immediately by letting you know your webpage is filtered while attempting to access the websites containing this content.


## BlockerX features

BlockerX offers a suite of free features to help you get started right away, including:



* **Porn blocker:** BlockerX has a database of over 2 million different adult websites on its block list and is constantly being updated to include new restricted content and apps.
* **Accountability partner:** You can designate an accountability partner by sending them an access code that prevents you from uninstalling the app without it.
* **Community:** The app offers free access to an [active community](https://community.blockerx.net/) of people who share a common goal of breaking free from addiction. The community support will help you stay motivated and encourage others to join in on your journey to becoming porn-free.
* **Incognito mode:** You can also enable the BockerX Chrome extension to work while browsing in Incognito Mode to prevent workarounds.

The features don’t stop there, though. If you decide to upgrade to a premium subscription (I’ll explain more later), it also gives you access to these premium features:



* **Panic switch:** Gives you the option to completely disable your internet connection for a set amount of time that you can adjust to help you resist those powerful urges to browse porn.
* **Uninstall notification:** Uninstalling the app will immediately notify your accountability partner so that they can reach out to you before you relapse.
* **VPN notification (for iOS):** Since the iOS app requires VPN access, turning off your VPN will notify your accountability partner immediately.
* **Daily report:** Your accountability partner will receive daily reports of your browsing activity to ensure that you stick to your goals.
* **URL & keyword blocker:** Unfortunately, even the most robust porn-blocking software can overlook a few websites or social media posts that host adult content. To combat this shortcoming, BlockerX lets you copy and paste URLs and keywords on its platform to block them from future searches.
* **Support up to 3 devices:** One account gives you cross-platform access for up to three devices. Installing the software on your phone, personal computer, and work computer or tablet ensures that there’s no easy workaround to accessing adult content.
* **Access to exclusive courses:** The app offers a short animated video course filled with valuable tips and information on how to break porn addiction.


## Pros & cons

* Simple user-interface
* No subscription is needed to start blocking porn sites
* Blocks distracting and explicit websites and apps with ease
* Compatible with Android, iOS, macOS, and PC
* Blocks porn even while browsing in Incognito Mode

Overall, the app works as advertised by helping you break the chain of porn addiction through a combination of a robust blocking system and accountability features to make sure you stick to your goals. It’s an all-in-one app for blocking porn and other harmful distractions, keeping you from becoming the man you’re destined to be.


## Frequently asked questions


### Is BlockerX compatible with iOS?

BlockerX is available in the App Store for iPhone and iPad running iOS 14.1 and up. To have the app run properly on iOS, you’ll need to permit it to set up a VPN profile. Once your VPN is turned ON, it will block access to adult websites and enforce safe search on search engines.

If you turn off the VPN to disable the app, it will notify your accountability partner that you’ve turned it off to provide an extra layer of protection.


### Is BlockerX compatible with Android?

You can download the BlockerX app on the Google Play Store for Android devices operating Android 6.0 and up. You can also sideload the app by downloading the BlockerX APK (Android Package Kit) from [their website](https://blockerx.net/app-to-block-porn-on-android/). Once downloaded, you can personalize your settings by switching on the features you wish to use.


### How much is BlockerX?

BlockerX is free, but the Premium version is available via an annual subscription plan for $89.99 ($7.49/month), including a 3-day free trial. Or you can opt for lifetime access to the software for a one-time payment of $179.99, including a 7-day money-back guarantee. If you decide to cancel your subscription during the free trial period, you won’t be charged.

## Final thoughts

BlockerX is a solid option primarily due to its compatibility with Android, iOS, and popular web browsers. If you’re looking for an app that can start blocking unwanted websites and apps for you, BlockerX’s free version is great for getting started. If you’re looking for something more, upgrading to the premium subscription gives you better control with added features like uninstall protection and daily accountability reports.

Overall, I’ve found [Covenant Eyes](/best-porn-blocker/) to be a better product due to their superior accountability reports and 24/7 customer support. But if you’re looking for a more affordable option with a similar set of features, you really [can’t beat BlockerX](https://blockerx.net). Give it a try and let me know what you think.
