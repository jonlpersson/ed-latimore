**Did you know?** There are 330 million monthly active users on Twitter. That‚Äôs larger than the population of the United States.

As Ed Latimore always says, you only need 1% of English speakers buying from you to live better than the other 99%.

In fact, you only need a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of them to engage with your content plus a business with one product, one service, one offer to **tweet your way to a six-figure income**

So what‚Äôs the difference between someone with 10,000 followers who makes a measly $100 a month from Twitter . . .

And someone with 1,000 followers who makes $10K?

**Authority changes everything.**

Buying and begging your way to disengaged followers won‚Äôt rake in the Benjamins‚Ä¶

. . . because you don‚Äôt have to beg for attention, pay for retweets, plagiarize big accounts, or message ‚Äúplease follow back üò≠üôè‚Äù to make money tweeting.

## **NOT Another ‚ÄúGrow Your Twitter‚Äù eBook (Or Course)**

Everyone who gets 10,000 followers puts out a ‚Äúhow to grow your Twitter‚Äù guide. They‚Äôre all full of the same ‚Äúreply, quote tweet, engage with bigger accounts‚Äù advice you can find in 45 seconds on Google.

All the Twitter gurus tell you when to tweet or how to style a tweet. But nobody has told you *what* to tweet or *how* to tweet it so that you **build authority**, **get praised by blue checks**, and **maximize results**.

Until now.

***The Best Way To Tweet It*** **fills the gaps** in all those courses and ebooks. It **shows** what other courses and e-books only **tell**.

Generic knockoffs (like what every Twitter ebook teaches) don‚Äôt help you grow your bottom line because people take one look at your timeline and go, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm already following accounts that say all this.‚Äù

Meanwhile, you‚Äôve noticed motivational tweets get all the replies, all the retweets, all the likes. But tweets with a link to buy? Almost nothing.

**It‚Äôs time to escape** from the ‚Äúmy platitudes go viral but my pitches get nothing‚Äù trap.

*The Best Way To Tweet It* will show you how to **build authority with internet strangers**,

**become important people‚Äôs favorite follow**,

and turn your Twitter account into a second (or seventh) **income stream**

even if you only have **100 followers**,

don't know **what to tweet** about,

**stopped growing** months ago,

have **no product** to sell,

and **can't write** for üí©.
