The internet is an incredible tool. Hell, it has played a significant role in helping me reach my goals as an entrepreneur and creator. But like most powerful tools, it can also be a double-edged sword.

Used irresponsibly, the internet can lead you down a dark path filled with bad habits and personal ruin. An obvious example is getting hooked on the internet's near-infinite supply of online pornography.

Porn, unlike drug use, is a silent addiction because it’s easy to lie to yourself and hide it from others. Even if you consider yourself a casual viewer, you probably know that your relationship with porn isn’t healthy. If you’re not sure here’s [six signs you’re definitely addicted to porn](https://edlatimore.com/6-signs-that-youre-definitely-addicted-to-porn/).

Deep down, you recognize some of the harmful effects it's having on your life, such as:

* Ruining the quality (and quantity) of your relationships
* Affecting your sex drive
* Setting you back spiritually
* Lowering your self-esteem
* Wasting your time and energy that you could be put towards productive hobbies

But dealing with porn addiction—no matter how severe—doesn’t have to be a losing battle. Instead of relying on sheer willpower, you can kick the bad habit for good by making it impossible to look at it in the first place by using a tool called a porn blocker. Note, I do recieve a small commission if you sign up with the links below.

## What is a porn blocker

Porn blockers are accountability software designed to block particular apps and websites known for hosting pornographic content. The software’s blacklist and safe search features make it impossible for you to browse porn on your laptop, smartphone or accidentally stumble upon it while surfing the web.

Some porn blocking software also has an accountability feature that shares your browsing activity with a trusted accountability partner and provides alerts when you try to delete the software or view explicit content. Eventually, by sheer force, the blocker will help reduce your urge to watch porn so that you can free yourself from addiction.

## Best porn blockers apps

There’s a lot of popular software and porn blocking apps out there designed to help, but these are the five best blockers I’ve found. It comes down to personal preference (and budget) for which blocker will work best for you.

### Net Nanny

Calling itself the \#1 rated porn blocker software since its release in 1996, Net Nanny uses advanced technology to evaluate the content on individual web pages in real-time without slowing down your computer or device.

Net Nanny’s content blocker keeps out porn by using real-time content filtering, allowing access to approved websites or category content types, and instantly allowing or blocking sites based on your preferences. It can even send alerts when inappropriate activity is detected.

The software also lets you manage your screen time by setting curfews and scheduling time limits for browsing the internet on your devices. If there's a particular time of day that you find yourself most tempted to browse porn sites, this is a great feature.

A yearly subscription is $39.99 for Mac or Windows, or you can choose to upgrade to the Family Protection Pass for $54.99/year to include protection on iOS, Android, and Kindle Fire.

Check out Net Nanny [here](https://www.netnanny.com/).

### AdGuard

AdGuard is a multipurpose tool that combines a privacy protection module and parental control tool for any web browser or app you’re on. Its ad filter blocks all types of ads, including pop-ups, video ads, and banners, while speeding up page loading times.

The software also blocks all types of trackers and analytical systems that spy on you by blocking third-party cookies, hiding your IP address, and providing an abundance of other features to protect your data.

While it doesn’t offer any accountability features, it’s also the most affordable option for those that just want to block adult sites and ads.

At $2.49/month, AdGuard is best for those that need protection on a budget. They also give you the option to buy a lifetime subscription for $79.99. Available for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS.

Get AdGuard [here](https://adguard.com/?aid=32872).

### Qustodio

While geared towards being a parental control app, Qustodio’s suite of features makes it an excellent option for blocking adult content. The app’s features include smart web filters, multi-device protection, advanced social media monitoring, games & apps blocking, time limits, and extended reporting.

If you’re looking for a quality option to protect yourself and your family members, Qustodio might be better suited for what you need. The small plan starts at $54.95/year for up to five devices or $96.95/year for 10. Available for Windows, Mac, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Android, iOS, and Kindle.

Get Qustodio [here](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7874&amp;awinaffid=1020691&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qustodio.com%2Fen%2F){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

### Covenant Eyes

Covenant Eyes has been one of the most popular and fastest-growing porn blockers in the market since its founding over 20 years ago. Their sleek app allows you to block particular sites and provides a detailed weekly report of your online activity. You can also send your reports to as many accountability partners as you want.

The app can even let you create separate profiles to track the online activity of other members of your family and send out notifications if you try to access blocked content. Covenant Eyes also works with a third-party VPN for Android devices, Mac, and Windows. However, you can’t use the app and a VPN at the same time if you’re using iOS devices.

Your subscription also gets you the added benefit of having access to Covenant Eyes’ complete knowledge base, including ebooks, guides, and videos to help you fight the temptation while browsing online.

It costs $16.99/month for protection on unlimited devices (Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, and Roku) and up to 10 users. They also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.

### X3 Watch

X3 Watch is another popular blocker that offers online accountability and monitoring. The software lets you send your tracked activity report to anyone you trust to hold you accountable. Attempts to uninstall the software or view blacklisted sites will send instant alerts to your accountability partner.

Other features include simple blocking capabilities and letting you check your report history up to two months back. A bonus for subscribing to X3 is that they also provide a library of educational and self-improvement tools to help you overcome addiction.

It costs $89/year for an individual plan, or you can upgrade to a family plan for $119/year. The subscription also includes an 8-part video series and eBook to help you kick the habit. Available on iOS, Mac, Android, Windows, Chromebook, and Kindle.

## How to choose which blocker is right for you

If you’re serious about quitting porn, then start by reading [this guide](https://edlatimore.com/how-to-quit-porn/). Each blocker has a different suite of features (and price points), but they’re all designed to block pornography so you can break the bad habit and get back to living a happier and healthier life.

If you’re on a budget and don’t think you need accountability, I’d start with AdGuard. If you’ve struggled with quitting in the past, then accountability is what you need. I recommend more advanced software that includes content for helping you quit, like Covenant Eyes or X3. If you want to protect other members of your family, too, I’d check out Qustodio.

## Frequently asked questions

### Are there ways around porn blocking software?

If there’s a will, there’s a way. However, the purpose of installing a porn blocker is to add enough friction to seeking out porn that you’ll likely go from being horny to frustrated. Breaking the habit is much easier once you make it inconvenient enough that you’ll eventually train your brain to stop seeking it.

### Does the software track your online activity, or can you remain anonymous?

Browsing porn is often a solo activity, which makes it such an easy addiction to fall prey to because it’s not hard to hide, even from those closest to you.

The purpose of installing a porn blocker is to make browsing adult websites less private so that you aren’t incentivized to maintain the habit. Having a trusted accountability partner that can view your browsing data safely and securely is a surefire way to help you break free from one of the most destructive isolating activities.
