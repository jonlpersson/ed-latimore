***For now, Gorilla Mind Rush seems to be discontinued. In place, check out my [review of Gorillia Mind Smooth](/gorilla-mind-smooth-review/). I love it all the same and bet it'll make a worthy addition to your nootropic stack.***

If you follow me on Twitter or elsewhere, you know that I am a big proponent of outworking your competition.

If you worked as hard as a crackhead looking for his next hit, you'd be on top of your game.

Perhaps my frequent tweets about crackheads are what's caused it, but for some reason, people are always asking me about what supplements I recommend.

First off: Don't do crack.

Second: I'm not a supplement expert. If you want the super scientific and rigorous advice of someone like Tim Ferriss, who's always experimenting with new stuff, you've come to the wrong place.

I can only tell you what works for me. And it's not very complicated, at all:

For mental focus and productivity, I recommend two things:

1. Black coffee
2. [Gorilla Mind Rush](https://bit.ly/2HFt6Te){: target="_blank"}

I especially love using both of these in the morning because in the morning, I either go to the gym or sit down to write. The combination really helps me kick-start my day with a jolt of energy and focus on whatever I'm doing.

## Why I switched from Modafinil to Gorilla Mind Rush

I used to take Modafinil, which is *strong*.

And it works.

But the problem with Modafinil, besides being potentially tricky to get your hands on, is its extremely long half-life:

The effects of Modafinil last for about 16 hours, which means you have to take it early in the morning if you want any chance of falling asleep at a reasonable hour.

I can't tell you how many sleepless nights I had to endure because things came up in the morning and I didn't get around to taking my Modafinil until noontime. It's truly an awful feeling being completely unable to fall asleep even when you're physically tired.

***(Visit [Nootropics Advisor](https://www.nootropicsadvisor.com/){: target="_blank"} for more information)***

Gorilla Mind Rush doesn't last for quite as long, which makes it more practical to use day-to-day.

But that's not the only reason why I ended up switching from Modafinil:

In my experience, Modafinil doesn't make you focused so much as it makes you alert.

Gorilla Mind Rush, on the other hand, is much [more conducive to deep focus](/how-to-focus-better/). I've never tried Adderall, but I suspect the effects of Gorilla Mind Rush is closer to Adderall than it is to Modafinil. It makes it easier to concentrate on just one thing, which is critical when you're trying to get something done.

With all that said though, don't take Gorilla Mind Rush right before you go to bed unless you plan to pull an all-nighter.

## What Gorilla Mind Rush feels like

Like I mentioned before, I consume Gorilla Mind Rush in the morning, on an empty stomach.

If you do the same, you'll notice the following happen to you:

**~15 minutes in**\: You begin to observe subtle changes in your overall energy and feelings.

**~30 minutes in**\: You experience clearer thinking, greater focus, and heightened productivity and motivation.

**~60 minutes in**\: This is where things start to get real interesting. Not only is it easier to concentrate, but you'll also notice decreased stress and anxiety levels. Your attention span is really big at this point.

**~90 minutes in**\: Your concentration, retention, and focus max out at this point. You'll remain at this level of focus for about five to six hours.

**~5-6 hours in**\: The effects begin to subside, but you don't "crash"—there are no severe losses of energy. You basically go back to normal.

Now, they recommend against using GMR with any caffeinated drink until you develop a tolerance for the nootropic. Once your tolerance has built up though, I recommend taking it with a cup of black coffee (the blacker the better). That's what I do.

## Benefits when working out

As a [professional heavyweight boxer](/boxing-benefits/) (13-1-1), my training regimen is very strict and very demanding. I hit the gym every day, almost without fail. And I go hard.

It's difficult to maintain top energy levels for a long period of time, but GMR has been a huge help and allowed me to do just that.

I get in the zone real quick and I'm able to keep it up for my whole workout session.

If you're looking to get that extra edge in the gym—*especially* if you're a competitive or professional athlete (or just [want to get to the level of one](/what-separates-professionals-from-amateurs/))—GMR is great. For maximum benefits, time your workout so that you work out about an hour and a half after consuming the Gorilla Mind Rush nootropic.

Having taken GMR for a number of months now, I've noticed the following main benefits:

## Cognitive benefits

By far the biggest value add that GMR has brought into my life is allowing me to focus on cognitively demanding tasks for very long periods of time.

I'm a prolific writer. In 2018, I published two new books: [*Sober Letters To My Drunken Self*]({{ '1791900798' | amazon }}){: target="_blank"} and *Engagement is the New Cocaine*.

Without Gorilla Mind Rush, I honestly don't know if I could have produced nearly as much writing as I did. With writing, momentum is everything. GMR makes it so much easier to get in the zone and just bang out a few thousand words in one sitting. It won't make you a *better* writer (that takes practice), but it will definitely make you a more *prolific* writer.

Another great benefit of the heightened focus and energy became obvious as I was pursuing my Physics degree. I chose to take considerably more classes than my peers. I won't lie, it was tough, but through hard work and the help of Gorilla Mind Rush, I was able to do it—and I scored higher than 93% of other Physics students in my school on the Major Field Test (which tests how much you've learned compared to other students).

## Car analogy

I've used this car analogy when describing the effects of Gorilla Mind Rush to friends in the past.

I basically think of my mind like a car, and GMR is like an anti-swerving system on steroids.

If you're like me, there are a lot of distractions competing for your attention when you sit down to work and it's easy to get side-tracked.

GMR makes it harder for me to turn my mind to things that aren't relevant to the task at hand. If you're into deep work and like being "in the zone", it's the perfect supplement.

## Unexpected benefit: Hunger suppression

I periodically fast for health reasons. I'm not sure if it's just me, but in my experience Gorilla Mind Rush helps suppress my hunger, making those fasting periods much easier to bear.

If you've tried GMR and have similar experiences (or if you don't), I'd love to know about it. Shoot me a tweet or hit me up on email.

## Science & ingredients

I'm no chemist, but I do like to know what I'm putting into my body.

Some nootropic blends try to obfuscate their ingredients (maybe because they're not as effective as they want to make you think, or maybe because they're worried about competitors copying them). Fortunately, Gorilla Mind is very transparent about what goes into their different products.

Here's the list of ingredients for Gorilla Mind Rush:

![Gorilla Mind Rush ingredient list](/assets/images/posts/gorilla-mind-rush-ingredients.jpg)

Gorilla Mind Rush contains the following ingredients (I have also included a short explanation of what each ingredient does—though I encourage you to do your own research, of course):

## Conclusion

I love Gorilla Mind Rush. It's the only supplement (aside from my workout supplements) that I use nowadays. And at $29.99 for a 3-month supply, I think it's a bargain.

If you want more energy and focus, and my review was helpful to you, I'd love you for using [my link](https://bit.ly/2HFt6Te){: target="_blank"} (I get a small % cut of each sale made through the link, which helps pay my bills).

I look forward to hearing your thoughts, reviews, and feedback. And if you're already using GMR, let me know about your experiences with it.
