I just finished going through Joshua Lisec’s persuasive writing course titled “The Best Way to Say It: How to Write Anything From Tweets To Books with Epic Persuasion”.

I wasn’t sure what to expect from a writing course on persuasion, but I was blown away. For you to fully appreciate why this course is so amazing, I have to remind you of something that is often forgotten:

Writing well is difficult.

*Writing persuasively is even more difficult.*

***Teaching people how to write well AND persuasively is the most difficult.***

As someone who believes [writing is so important](/why-is-writing-important/), I can tell you first-hand how challenging it is to teach writing–especially over the internet. This is because good writing is one of those things that is difficult to objectively measure.

You know it when you see it, but it’s not *quite* subjective.

Telling the difference between good and bad writing is like judging the attractiveness of a person: even if we can’t say exactly what makes someone good looking, we *know* when someone is ugly. We may disagree on *how* attractive a person is, but we’re all generally in agreement on whether a person is easy or hard on the eyes.

Joshua Lisec’s course on writing attempts to teach you how to clearly and engagingly communicate any idea in the fewest amount of words possible. Even better, the course also teaches you how to do this persuasively.

His goal is to make you both a more effective, efficient, and persuasive writer. It’s a challenge but if anyone can do it, it’s Lisec.

## Who Is Joshua Lisec?

[From his website](https://entrepreneurswordsmith.com/)\:

*Joshua Lisec is the world’s only award-winning, celebrity-recommended, \#1 international bestselling Certified Professional Ghostwriter.*

*Since 2011, he’s ghostwritten more than 50 full-length books as well as 1,000s of articles, blog posts, speeches, and white papers for household name entrepreneurs, executives, politicians, public figures, and the breakthrough stars of tomorrow in over 100 different industries.*

*He’s also a ghostwriter for Forbes Contributors you read, a TEDx speaker, and a two-time published novelist.*

In short, he’s a man who knows the game of writing. For obvious reasons, he can’t disclose his clients, but he makes a healthy living from ghostwriting and as a contributing speaker on the topic of writing.

**The persuasion writing system he teaches is one he’s used with his own clients to earn over $1 million in the past couple years.**

| I originally connected with him because I saw that he followed me on Twitter. He has an excellent website on writing and I’m always looking to get better with words. I discovered his course because he found out that I was editing an \[old book of mine\]({{ '1542628806'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;amazon }}) to reflect my improved writing abilities. |

He offered to edit a chapter of mine in return for using it in the course. This may seem like a win-win, but I assure you that I made out better on the deal.

## What’s Taught In The Writing Course?

The premise of the course is that a piece of writing only comes to life in the rewrites and edits.

As Ernest Hemingway once said, “The first draft of anything is shit.”

The meat of the course is two 25 minute lessons: “Restructure for perfect flow” and “Refine for Maximal Persuasion”. There are bonuses about SEO and client acquisition as a freelance writer, which are great, but the course shines as a masterclass on the two most important components of engagingly persuasive writing.

### The structure and engagement of persuasive writing

You get to see these principles applied to different pieces of writing and ***this*** is where you really get what you paid for.

It’s one thing to be told which principles to follow, but it’s another thing entirely to watch a master use them and explain how his mind works in the process. Seeing Joshua work real-time cleaning up pieces of writing is worth the price of the course alone.

While it takes him a little over two hours, you get to see something that many other courses don’t offer–a real-time live look at the process that leads to the promised. This is better than any testimonial or case study. In fact, this is better than most college level writing courses. Rarely do you get to see an author work let alone explain to you why he’s making certain decisions.

It’s not one on one mentorship, but it’s ***damn*** close and it's superior to every other writing course on the market that does not have an instructor working with you real time. This is so effective that I do not doubt that the method will be copied in the future, but it won’t matter because being good at something doesn’t mean you can teach it effectively. Fortunately, Joshua excels as both a practitioner and instructor.

You get to see the author work though the thought process of editing a piece for maximum engagement and clarity. And he trims the pieces down to get it done in less than 500 words.

The writing modules are short and Joshua is a dynamic presenter, so you never feel bored watching him in any part of the course. This is important because even though there are downloadable cheat sheets that cover the big ideas, there is a lot of information you’ll need to listen aptly for.

### Persuasive writing solves "decision fatigue"

Just as important, Joshua's course is a system that solves decision fatigue. Because we spend so much time online, this means that we're constantly in the game of persuasion or being persuaded.

In order to influence others, we have to write. Even if we don't want to. Even when we hate it. But we must.

Every time you have to start copy from scratch and consult your Muse, you lose energy and the quality drops. Do this enough, and decision fatigue **will** cost you money.

This persuasion writing system makes decisions for you so that your copy writes itself the right way, the first time, every time, whether it's a 300 word blog post or a 300-page book.

I've often referred to this as a "persuasion writing" course. Writing is the means to the end - persuasion so people click, subscribe, share, scroll, comment, buy, buy again, and tell others to buy. That's persuasion, and that's what "The Best Way To Say It" gives you.

Success online hinges on good copy. If you're not actively applying proven principles of your persuasion to your copy–from initial idea to final draft–the result is not simply not persuasive; your copy is anti-persuasive. Persuasion is a zero-sum game. Either you are persuading people to click, to subscribe, to scroll, to comment, and to buy, or you are unintentionally persuading them not to. Which do you want?

I’ve actually watched the course twice now: once just to get a general feel for it and again to take notes. I’m not a professional on the level of Joshua, but I know [how to write well](/how-to-write-better-and-be-a-better-writer/) enough to make a living and grow a decent social media following. With that said, I learned a tremendous amount from the two 25 minute lessons and then watching him apply the principles on various writing styles and genres.

## My Final Verdict On “The Best Way To Say It”

At $99, this is a steal. You probably took a writing class in college that 5-10x that much and not taught even half as well.

Lisec understands that showing is better than telling. There are only two lessons of pure instruction and they’re both under 30 minutes.

The majority of the course is him watching him edit articles, sales copy, lead magnets, and technical writing. The sheer versatility of the types of writing on display show you that his methods and techniques truly do work to communicate anything in 500 words or less.

I highly recommend you pick this course up before he raises the price because it is ***seriously*** undervalued.
