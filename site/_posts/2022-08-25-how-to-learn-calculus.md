  I failed calculus 3 times and still graduated with a BA in Physics. Here’s how I finally learned calculus.

I was never naturally good at math.

I failed calculus three times before the concepts finally sank in.

It wasn’t until after I learned some principles for getting better at math in general that I was able to pass the 4th time. I went from failing most of my high school math classes to making $1K a week tutoring students in math, chemistry, and physics.

Calculus is an entry point and prerequisite to learning higher levels of math. It's also the most widely used form of math in the real-world beyond basic arithmetic.

For example, the algorithms that keep you watching more content on social media platforms are often based on calculus.

Calculus is the study of rates of change over tiny intervals of time. The problem is, though it has real-world applications, learning calculus is mostly about learning to use it in theory vs application. This turns off beginners and anyone who might have a natural inclination toward it.


## The genius myth

Some people have a different set of mental faculties but what we think of as a genius is rarely inherent brain power. More often, genius is an uncanny/uncommon desire and ability to focus on a subject until it’s learned.

Einstein, Nobel prize winning physicist Richard Feynman, and Newton were all ordinary dudes with extraordinary curiosity. This holds true outside of math and physics as well.

Johann Sebatian Bach famously stated his true talent in music was an inclination to work hard. Some of you might remember the movie _Searching for Bobby Fischer_. It was based on the childhood chess master, Josh Waitzkin. Though revered as one, Waitzkin has since written books about how he wasn’t a genius, but he was a curious, thorough learner.

I tell you about these things because even so-called geniuses realize that the biggest hurdle is actually believing it can be done. And your capabilities can blossom from there.

Learning calculus today doesn’t mean you’ll start Space X 2.0. You don’t have to be destined for MIT or even a career as a mathematician. You simply have to [develop a growth mindset around math.](https://edlatimore.com/how-to-get-better-at-math/)

Anyone can learn calculus and the following sections will show you the easiest way I know how.


## Learn the parts

Learning calculus is like the next steps in language learning. You’ve gotten the basic words and sentences down when you learned Algebra and other prerequisites. Now it’s time to write essays and fit larger concepts together. The first thing to know about solving calculus problems is that there are basically three main segments of calculus:



* Limits
* Derivatives
* Integrals

**Limits**

Limits form the foundation of calculus and help us predict an unknown number to a reasonable level of closeness. Otherwise, we’d be left in the black hole of infinite possibilities.

For example, to predict the speed of a vehicle, you need to know the distance traveled divided by the time it took to get there. Limits come into play when you need to find the speed of that same vehicle as it approached a single point along that distance.

**Derivatives**

Derivatives measure the slope of a curve at a given point, called a tangent line. Put all together, it helps to find how an output will change in respect to an input over time. This is where you get into differential calculus.

**Integrals**

Integrals work backwards from derivatives. This branch of mathematics also goes by the names of integration or antidiferrentials. Integrals help us find the area of oddly shaped things. Formally, this method is called finding the area under a curve.

Integrals help us calculate:



* Area
* Accumulation
* Probability
* Volume
* Distance


## Write the steps

All learning will involve some rote, repetitive memorizing. But to study calculus more thoroughly, you’ll need to take it a step further.

Nobel prize winning physicist Richard Feynman knew that if he could break down a subject to its most important concepts, he could learn it. His method was later dubbed the Feynman technique. Anyone can use this technique to better understand and study any topic.

**The Feynman Technique**

1. Take out a sheet of paper and at the top write down the concept you are trying to understand
2. Explain each step in the concept as if you are teaching it to someone else. Go back to class notes or reference materials to further explain tough concepts.
3. Simply the language and/or use an analogy to better understand and visualize the important concepts
4. Work through the technique to test yourself for understanding without referring to your notes or class material.

To use this technique to learn calculus, you’ll need to use practice problems to work through each step. It’ll help you grasp the concepts behind limits, derivatives, and integrals while also working through practice problems.

For more thorough learning, you can also [read my easy 4-step process for problem solving](https://edlatimore.com/problem-solving-process/). It’ll help you better understand any problem you come across.

In my studies, I found working through problems then usings a tool like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math) helps to check my work. It helped me understand where I went wrong and correct my mistakes for other problems. Here’s a warning though—don’t cheat. Taking the easy way doesn’t form the necessary neurotransmitters in your brain for deep work. And the sooner you learn to use your brain to figure out hard things, the better.


## Don’t rely on class alone

Calculus class should be an intro to new important concepts and to clarify what you’re learning. You shouldn’t be relying on it to do your learning for you. In high school, your teachers will go at your pace until you learn. Calculus courses in college leave it up to you to do the heavy-lifting of learning.

If you feel like you are floundering, [find a good tutor](https://edlatimore.com/qualities-of-a-good-teacher/). Good tutors are often those that struggled to learn, like me, and figured it out. Which means they can help you figure it out also. They can also teach you how to calculate calculus graphs and functions without becoming handicapped by a graphing calculator.

In the real-world, calculus is used in financial market predictions and places like computer science. It can be difficult to understand by theory alone. For example, the way mathematicians like Leibniz learned isn’t how we learn today, which focuses more on the fundamental theorem of calculus and not how to use it.

And because theories can muddy the practicality of a tool, you need to seek help and use practice problems outside of the classroom.

…which brings us to the next point.


## Repeat, repeat, repeat

Math is not a subject you can coast on learning through listening. You need hands-on work to grasp the important concepts and usefulness. Now, you probably won’t be using trigonometric identities or differential equations on a regular basis in life. But learning to work through these concepts can teach you about yourself.

When you learn something difficult, you learn perseverance and confidence. These attributes carry on throughout life and become a reference point for self-improvement.

Put simply, get more practice with more problems. Books like [Calculus by James Stewart](https://www.cengage.com/c/calculus-8e-stewart/9781285740621PF/) (in any addition) is full of practice problems you can work through over and over.


## Use your accumulated knowledge

Calculus ties together other areas of math that you usually learn first. For example, calculus finds equations in nature then uses algebra to solve them.

Math learning typically flows in this manner:



* Addition, subtracting, multiplication, division
* Algebra
* Geometry
* Trigonometry
* Calculus

Calculus is really Algebra’s big brother. Many of the concepts that seem so daunting are sequences of algebraic functions. When you know how to properly break down fractions and polynomials you’ll have an easier time with calculus.

Before you get to calculus, you usually take a prerequisite called precalculus, which is a more advanced version of Algebra. Master your prerequisite learning, and calculus will be easier to grasp.


## Wrapping up

Now, you  don’t have to be a mathematician, but with these tips you can get good enough at calculus to pursue a career or simply to pass your calc tests.

Here’s the short version of how to learn calculus (the easiest way I know how):



* Develop a growth mindset. If it can be learned, you can learn it
* Understand the parts of calculus and what it seeks to accomplish
* Write the steps thorough and simply, then refine them further
* Don’t rely on calculus class to do your learning for you, get help
* Practice approaches perfection
* Learn your prerequisites

If I can go from seeing dead bodies in the hood to becoming one of the top performing physics students in the country, you can learn calculus.

I hope that helps.

The rest is up to you.
