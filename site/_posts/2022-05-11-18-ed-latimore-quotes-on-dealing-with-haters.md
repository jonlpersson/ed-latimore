When you log onto social media, it seems like everyone is talking about how many haters they have or how much hate they get because they’re successful. I even wrote an article explaining why haters hate and how to deal with these types of negative people.

This isn’t how to deal with a pack of haters, per se. Rather, It’s a collection of my best quotes about understandings why “haters gonna hate” and in doing so, there is some wisdom about how to deal with them.

In that way, these “haters quotes” are kind of like motivational quotes for those of us who suddenly find ourselves dealing with a certain type of random negativity that seems to have no cause.

When your real friends turn to fake friends and your biggest fans turn into your biggest haters, these inspirational quotes will hopefully help you navigate and under what’s going on. These are 100% original quotes from me, Ed Latimore. All I ask is that if you use them, just give me credit.

If you've been an asshole though, you might find yourself getting a lot of hate.&nbsp;
