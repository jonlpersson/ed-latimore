[Gorilla Mode](https://gorillamind.com/r?id=01kb6h) is the pre-workout claiming to outwork all pre-workouts by providing the maxed-out formula in all aspects compared to anything else you’ll find on the market. It’s a quality product that doesn’t hold back on delivering the perfect blend to help you hit the next level.

## What to expect from Gorilla Mode

![One tub of Gorilla Mode pre-workout formula](/assets/images/posts/gorilla-mode.jpg "My favorite flavor, Tiger’s Blood")

I mix 1-2 scoops of Gorilla Mode with 12-14 ounces of water 30 minutes before my training sessions to get the best results. If I want my pre-workout to hit harder, I’ll take the full two-scoop dose on an empty stomach before a morning workout.

If you’re somewhat sensitive to caffeine or new to pre-workout supplements, I recommend starting with half a scoop and observing how well your body handles it. Once you build up a tolerance, you can adjust your serving as needed.

Here’s what I notice after taking it, although your experience may vary:

**Within 15 minutes:** I start to feel more alert and focused, although it could just be the placebo effect since the caffeine hasn’t hit just yet.

**Within 30 minutes:** My brain is on fire, and I can feel the blood coursing through my veins. My body is ready to hit the weights or speed bag if I haven't already.

**Within 90 minutes:** I’m still going strong, thanks to the muscular endurance and cognitive boost. If I know that my workout will go longer than usual, GM is a must to maintain my edge throughout.

**After 6-8 hours:** By this point, I’ve already hit the half-life of caffeine and observe no noticeable effects from the pre-workout. If anything, I may feel somewhat fatigued from the training session, but that’s because [I choose to hit it hard.](/pushing-through-the-pain/)

## Benefits

### Increased muscle strength and endurance

Gorilla Mode provides a massive increase in nitric oxide (NO) levels, intramuscular hydration, energy, focus, and a significant boost in muscle strength and endurance that you’ll be hard pressed to find in any pre-workout.

The massive dose of L-Citrulline, GlycerPump, Agmatine, Creatine, and Betaine saturate your muscles with blood to maximize your pump and performance while balancing your energy levels and focus to complete those [long, grueling workouts.](/boxing-training/)

### Increased focus

Gorilla Mode isn’t just a powerful strength enhancer; it also provides a significant cognitive boost thanks to its nootropic formula of L-Tyrosine, Kanna, and Huperzine A. Combined, this formula significantly increases energy, focus, and overall mental sharpness.

Taking Gorilla Mode has helped me up my intensity and mental clarity in the gym. It's much easier to stay locked in and push for those extra reps without feeling distracted or wanting to give up.

## Drawbacks

### Powerful stimulant

The 175 mg of caffeine per serving in the product can make you feel jittery if you take the max recommended dose of two scoops. I’ve also found that it’s not smart to use the product for workouts later in the day, as the caffeine dose can wreck your sleep. But everyone reacts differently, so start with a smaller dose and experiment until you find what works best for you.

## Gorilla Mode ingredients

I’m a big fan of the Gorilla Mind product line due to the owner [Derek’s transparency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSgecUqjxrs&amp;t=1s) about what goes into the products, which can’t always be said about other popular nootropic and pre-workout blends. And since I’m strict about what I put in my body, I only take what I recognize and know is healthy for me.

Here’s the list of ingredients found in Gorilla Mode:

![Supplement fact sheet for Gorilla Mode pre-workout](/assets/images/posts/gorilla-mode-ingredients.png "Supplement fact sheet")

I’ve also included a short explanation of what each ingredient does—though I encourage you to do your research. [Examine](https://examine.com/) is a trusted resource for learning more about each ingredient.

* **L-Citrulline:** An amino acid that can help reduce fatigue, increase power output, and improve endurance in both aerobic and anaerobic exercise.
* **Creatine Monohydrate:** An organic compound commonly found in meat and fish. When combined with resistance training, [research has shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407788/) that it can improve strength, [power output](https://examine.com/topics/power-output/), and lean mass.
* **GlycerPump™:** A unique formula consisting of 65% Glycerol powder that hyper-hydrates your muscles to increase muscle pump.
* **Betaine Anhydrous:** Also known as trimethylglycine (TMG), this naturally occurring compound can potentially enhance strength-based performance and hypertrophy by increasing blood flow and reducing fatigue.
* **L-Tyrosine:** An amino acid that helps [reduce stress and enhance cognitive function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6084775/) by balancing the neurotransmitters in your brain.
* **Agmatine Sulfate:** A neurotransmitter and neuromodulator with anti-anxiety and antidepressant-like effects to help elevate mood. It can also [manipulate the body’s pain receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC27068/), allowing you to power through more intense workouts.
* **Kanna:** A South African herb that [reduces anxiety, increases cognition, and improves reaction time](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23903032/).
* **Caffeine Anhydrous:** A powerful stimulant made using the seeds and stems of the coffee plant and dehydrating for increased concentration. [Caffeine has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4803635/) to improve physical strength and endurance and is classified as a [nootropic](https://examine.com/supplements/nootropic/) because it sensitizes neurons and provides mental stimulation.
* **N-Phenethyl:** Also known as the “love drug,” this nootropic increases the release of serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline.
* **Bioperine:** A trademarked formula of black pepper extract standardized to 95% Piperine that’s commonly used as an anti-inflammatory agent and antioxidant, capable of eliminating free radicals within the body.
* **Huperzine A:** A cognitive enhancer that increases cognitive function and memory, helps body composition, and combats aging.

I do love how in the zone it makes me feel. Even without even if you aren't working out, you could use it to get a lot of mental tasks done.

## How it compares to other pre-workouts

Walk into any gym or commercial nutrition store, and you’ve likely come across a variety of pre-workout supplements packaged with bright colors and bold claims. It can be overwhelming to pick which product is right for you amid the marketing hype and confusing trademarked pre-workout formulas.

To help you out, here’s how Gorilla Mode performs against some of the most popular pre-workouts on the market.

### Gorilla Mode vs. DAS LABS Bucked Up

DAS LABS’ Bucked Up has made quite a name for itself in the health influencer space. Good branding and a relentless marketing campaign have put this pre-workout on everyone’s radar. But how does it stack up?

Bucked Up shares a similar formula with Gorilla Mode, with the big difference being that its caffeine content is a bit higher at 200mg per serving and the addition of 2,000mg of Beta-Alanine.

If you’re not familiar with Beta-Alanine, it’s a common ingredient found in pre-workout supplements that makes your skin itch to give you the sensation that the product is working without providing any real performance improvement. If you prefer the tingling sensation, you may enjoy this one, but it’s not something I look for in my pre-workouts.

I’ll also add that a 30-serving container of Bucked Up is $49.99, which comes out to $1.67 per serving, which is a bit steeper than Gorilla Mode’s $1.23 per serving for a 40-serving container.

### Gorilla Mode vs. Transparent Labs BULK

BULK is another popular pre-workout supplement from the well-trusted brand, Transparent Labs. Unlike Gorilla Mode, which has 2,500mg of Creatine, BULK contains a unique Testosterone Support Complex to support muscle growth and includes a hefty 4,000mg dose of Beta-Alanine.

BULK is offered at the same price-per-serving as Bucked UP, making it a pricier option. Still, Transparent Labs is a quality brand that lives by its name by providing 100% transparency about its ingredients and using third-party testing.

If the cost (and your facing tingling) isn’t a concern, it’s a solid option. But if you're looking for the best value-per-scoop, Gorilla Mind is excellent compared to other pre-workouts—even at just a half dose.

## Frequently asked questions

Before I try any new supplement or product, I always do my research to ensure it makes sense to take. Here are some common questions I get about GM so you can make your own decisions about whether or not it’s right for you.

### Can I stack it with other supplements?

You can stack [Gorilla Mode](https://gorillamind.com/r?id=01kb6h){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} with [Gorilla Mind Smooth](https://gorillamind.com/r?id=8q1f8k){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a stim-free product that can improve concentration for those more intense workouts that require intense focus. But use as directed and do your research before combining GM with other stim-based supplements, and never exceed your daily serving.

### Should I ever cycle off Gorilla Mode?

To remain sensitive to the product, you should always consider cycling off any stimulant-based products for at least 5-7 days every month. I naturally cycle its usage since I only take it during intense workout sessions a few times per week, which you could do the same.

### Are there any side effects?

The main side effect is that caffeine can give you the jitters if you take a higher dose than your body is accustomed to. If you’re sensitive to caffeine, consider lowering your dose and don’t take it later in the day unless you want to risk not falling asleep.

### How does Gorilla Mode taste?

Gorilla Mode comes in a variety of flavors, including popular options such as Fruit Punch, Cherry Blackout, Watermelon, Mango Peach, and—my favorite—Tiger’s Blood.

I find that it tastes pretty good for a pre-workout supplement, especially the original Tiger’s Blood flavor, which is a blend of watermelon, strawberry, and coconut. If you find the flavors to be a bit strong, you can dilute them by adding more water.

## Conclusion

Gorilla Mode has become my go-to pre-workout for when I want to hit the gym hard. It’s the best pre-workout for the money for increasing muscle growth and endurance. It also keeps me hyper-focused and energized in the morning due to the caffeine and nootropic formula.

If you’re looking to maximize your mental and physical performance at the gym, I recommend giving GM a try. However, if you’re sensitive to stimulants, you should be cautious due to the high dose of caffeine. Just be sure to introduce this pre-workout slowly and never exceed two scoops.
