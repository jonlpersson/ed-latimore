The journey to being a better man is both internal and external.

That’s why I’m a fan of making yourself likable and as physically attractive as possible. It helps you show up in the world with more confidence which leads people to treat you better. One way to show up better in the world is by defining your face. Whether you like it or not, how you look communicates things about you.

Having a defined jawline makes you more attractive to women but also makes you appear stronger. Working your head and neck muscles also has long-term benefits for your spine.

My favorite way to define my face is with mastic gum. In this review, I’ll walk you through what mastic gum is, where it comes from, and what to expect.


## What is mastic gum?

Mastic gum is the crystalized sap produced in the branches and trunk of the mastic tree. Due to underwater volcanic activity of the Mediterranean, the island of Chios, Greece is the only place this tree is able to grow.

I came across mastic gum after the owner of Greco Gum suggested it. I’d expressed interest in passing that I was looking for ways to define and shape my jawline.

Mastic gum primarily comes in small, irregular chewable pieces that you can pop in and chew for hours. It’s not anything like what you traditionally think of as chewing gum. It’s a completely natural product free of synthetic ingredients, artificial flavors, and the like.

I use mastic gum in the chewable resin pieces but as a dietary supplement, you can find mastic gum in these forms:



* Mastic oil
* Mastic capsules
* Mastic essential oil
* Mastic gum powder


## Other uses and health benefits of mastic gum

Mastic gum is also referred to as Pistacia lentiscus or Chios mastiha. It’s a natural source with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Currently, mastic gum is most popular for its jawline-building power but several studies have found it has benefits for digestive health.[^1] For example, mastic gum supplements help to kill the helicobacter pylori bacteria which causes stomach ulcers.

Mastic gum has been found to help with:



* Inflammatory bowel disease
* Inflammation
* Probiotic supplementation
* Obesity
* Reducing liver enzymes for non-alcoholic patients
* High cholesterol
* Cardiovascular health


## How often do you use mastic gum?

I treat mastic gum like any other resistance workout. I don’t do it for more than 2-3x a week. You need to rest anyway as you can really feel it working your jawline. Like typical workouts, you’ll need to give it 3-4 weeks before you start to notice any real results.

For me, gym is life. It's [a way to a more stoic, centered life](https://edlatimore.com/how-to-increase-willpower/) and ensuring that I can control my mind, body, and emotions. It also helps me to maintain a level of attractiveness.


## What I liked about mastic gum

The following are a few pros that I found chewing mastic gum:

**It works**

If you want a more muscular face, mastic gum will help you achieve that. I’ve used it as a means of building a more masculine face and also as a way to [become more physically attractive to women](https://edlatimore.com/how-to-become-more-physically-attractive-to-women/#build-a-strong-jawline). Women are by and large attracted to male physiques that cue strength.[^2] A strong jawline is a marker of health and physical strength.

**It’s discrete**

Mastic gum is discrete and easy to forget about. Since you’re just chewing gum, you can do it anywhere and no one knows that you’re putting in reps.

**No negative side-effects**

I didn’t experience any negative side effects like gastrointestinal upset or heartburn which is possible with any supplement. Other than muscle soreness in the face, it’s like chewing hard gum.


## What I don’t like about mastic gum

The following are a couple of cons I found chewing mastic gum:

**The taste**

Mastic gum is definitely all business. While you’d be hard-pressed to find anything that matches its ability to give you the defined look you want, it doesn’t taste great.

However, while the initial taste is a little off-putting, it quickly fades. It’s not like the sugary gum you’re used to. In fact, it lacks any sugar at all. I think this is a good thing because sugar isn’t good for your long-term oral health.

**Quality varies**

Unfortunately, the quality of mastic gum varies widely among sellers. You can get gum with impurities like dirt and debris that isn’t fit for consumption. There’s also a process you have to go through to make sure the gum is at the proper level of resistance. Otherwise, the gum is more sticky instead of hard.


## The best mastic gum brand

There are several sellers of mastic gum but like I said before, the quality varies. My preferred brand is [Greco Gum](https://www.grecogum.com/?via=ed). The founders pride themselves on making superior quality gum and their marketing is humorous.

There are many copycats but Greco Gum is the real deal. Like I said before, mastic gum has to go through a process of purification and ensuring the resistance level is right. Greco Gum goes through this process and doesn’t rush harvest and production just to get something on the shelves.


## Mastic Gum vs Jawzrsize

Before using mastic gum, I was using Jawzrsize. Jawzrcise is a rubber ball you put in your mouth and bite down on for reps. Compared to mastic gum it works, but it's not something you can do in public without looking like you have a rubber ball in your mouth.

It’s funny, I actually started using that tool to build a stronger chin for boxing. If you’ve ever heard anything about boxing, I'm sure you’ve heard the phrase “He’s got a good chin,” or a “weak chin.” This alludes to how easy it is to knock you out.

The Jawzrcise tool sits at the front of your mouth which works a different muscle group. This is called “incisor-based.” Because you chew mastic gum in the back of your mouth, you work different muscles. This creates “molar-based” training.

The difference between the two is that incisor-based exercises cause your head to round more at the top. Molar-based exercises give your jawline a more square look.


## Mastic Gum vs other jawline-defining methods

Here are some alternatives people try to chewing mastic gum:

**Mewing**

Mewing is the act of positioning your tongue at the roof of your mouth and pressing. It’s supposed to change your face shape and correct issues like sleep apnea and crooked teeth. It was invented by an orthodontist in the 70s.

Tongue positioning is at the heart of several facial workout regimens because the tongue is a strong muscle. However, mewing by itself has no scientific evidence to support that it actually works.

**Losing weight**

Losing weight is the first step on any journey to sculpt your body. It won’t give you a stronger jawline but it’ll help provide more contour or contrast to the different areas of your face. Just like abs, you can’t see a muscular face if it's hiding under a layer of fat.

Weight-training your neck can work the muscles around your neck, but you’ll get a more targeted workout with mastic gum. Training your neck can be beneficial to your health in the long term.

**Neck curl-ups**

Neck curls are like sit ups except you lift your head instead of engaging your core. This is one of many exercises recommended to help people suffering from chronic jaw pain. Like weight-training your neck, over time it can help to build up the muscles in your jaw. However, without resistance, this process could take months or years to give your face the sharp look you're going for.


## Would I recommend mastic gum to define your jawline?

For what it does, I’d definitely recommend mastic gum. But if you’re looking for a sugary treat to chop on when you’re bored, this ain't it. A single tin can last you months when used regularly and is fresh for years. Mastic gum is my go-to now for face-building. And Greco Gum is my go-to brand.
