This week's newsletter is short, but hopefully it will change someone's life.

In case you aren't aware, I've been sober since December 23rd, 2013. Time really does fly. It feels like just yesterday I was doing everything I could to drink as much as I could, with little regard for my life, responsibilities and my relationships.

Although it'll be 10 years this December, my memories of being a hardcore alcoholic are fresh in my mind. These memories ensure that I'm never tempted to pick up the bottle again.

My struggle with and triumph over alcohol abuse lead me to write&nbsp;***"Sober Letters To My Drunken Self,"***&nbsp;a book for people struggling with the emotional side of sobriety ([grab a copy here](https://amzn.to/3kIOOLw){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}).

It's also allowed me to use my story to teach others lessons of courage and compassion I've learned along the way.

A short film about my journey from a broken childhood, to alcoholism, to boxing and sobriety has just been released by the&nbsp;[Starts With Us](https://www.startswith.us/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}&nbsp;foundation.

An interesting thing about filming: I feel like this took almost 6 hours and they were able to edit my story down to a beautiful tight 5 minutes and 27 seconds.

Check it out this short and impactful watch.

If you got something from it, I'd love for you to share it on your social media platform of choice. Or just send it to someone close to you who needs to hear the message. Click below to watch.
