Your relationships with other people are the most important thing in your life.

It doesn’t matter how much money you make or how many things you accomplish if you don’t have any good friends to share your life with. If you doubt that, imagine hitting all of your goals and accomplishments. Then imagine that you have no friends to celebrate with, no family members to call, and no one who really cares—and the likes you get on social media don’t count.

That emptiness you felt is the importance of friendship. You don’t even need a large social circle, but it needs to exist. It doesn’t matter if you’re an extrovert, introvert, or somewhere in between. You still need at least a few close friends to share your life with.

Social media friends and co-workers don’t count—at least not initially. You have to transition those digital acquaintances and work buddies into new friendships. The following articles outline some useful methods for making new friends, no matter what you are or what you’re doing.

## How to improve social skills
