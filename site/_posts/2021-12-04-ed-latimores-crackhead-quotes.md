These are a collection of quotes I've put together about crackheads or that I've heard crackheads say. Some people have formally studied crackheads and know them better than me, but I've got a "Ghetto PhD" in crackheadology.

You can read about my childhood [growing up in the projects here](/the-projects/). In the projects, there are a lot of crackheads. In fact, crackheads are integral to the ghetto experience and economy.

You can read about my experiences [with crackheads here.](/crackhead/)

For further crackhead insight, you can read my lesson on [how to develop crackhead-like hustle here.](/how-to-hustle-like-a-crackhead/)

There are also the legendary [Ten Crack Commandments that I've broken down](/ten-crack-commandments-business-and-life-lessons/) for you to apply to your life and business.

If you told me that you grew up in the hood but you never dealt with crackheads, I'd know that you were lying. Crackheads and the ghetto go together like cocaine and baking soda.

This list of crackhead quotes is divided into original crackhead quotes from me and crackhead quotes from other people. I hope you are entertained and leave with something of value.

All I ask is that if you use one of my quotes somewhere, given me credit.
