The concept of the "surface area of luck" refers to the notion that the more opportunities you make available to yourself, the more likely it is that a fortunate event will occur.

The idea is that while luck can be thought of as random chance, you can increase the chances of experiencing a lucky break by maximizing your exposure to potential serendipitous events.

the "surface area of luck" refers to the idea that luck can be cultivated by maximizing your chances for positive, random opportunities through broad and diverse life experiences. Taking action expands the playing field where good fortune can take hold.

But is there more to luck than this, and if there is, how do we practically implement this idea into lives for better outcomes?

Luck plays a significant role in the life of any successful person.

Hard work is important, but a little good fortune goes a long way in being successful.

Everyone's gotten a lucky break or two, but people don’t like to admit this for two big reasons:

1) People believe that it takes away from the effort they put in. After all, even people who are OBVIOUSLY lucky don’t like to hear that’s why they have a good life. If you reduce all success to “right place, right time,” how can you seriously be considered as a candidate for the power of initiative and hard work?

2) They severely misunderstand what luck is. Most think it’s picking the right numbers or winning the “genetic lottery.” These things help you excel, but they don’t matter

Dealing with the first misunderstanding is a natural result of dealing with the second.

Before I define luck, let me warn you: it will probably differ from whatever’s in Webster’s dictionary. If you’re satisfied with your luck, read theirs instead.

***Ed Latimore’s Definition Of Luck:*** Let “n” be an intended or predicted outcome. Let k be any number of events that occur because of “n.” The unintended n+k order of effects of an action is luck.

Now that we know what luck is, next is the life-changing question: how do we get more of it in our lives?
