  Networking on Twitter is a lot like networking in real life. Here’s how I add
  value and build relationships on this social media platform.

Twitter is one of the largest social media platforms on the planet, bringing in 450 million active users per month.<sup><a class="footnote" rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>

That’s roughly the equivalent of every single man, woman, and child living in the United States and Mexico. Tweets changed how we communicate, especially when it comes to breaking news and timely conversations.

Like any social media platform, there’s lots of noise on Twitter. However, you can change your entire life on Twitter if your mindset is right. In this article, I will explain why Twitter is an excellent networking tool, and how you can use it to take your career, brand, and money to the next level.

## 1\. Always add value

Life has always, and always will boil down to givers and takers. The main rule that has garnered me success on Twitter and in my professional life is to add value.

The only way you can provide value to someone else is by first, making yourself valuable. I’ve chosen to demonstrate my expertise with my writing and background.

Twitter reaches such a large number of people. Ideas propagate around the world. By using my writing and background to add value, it naturally opens me up to new relationships and opportunities with the people who appreciate the value that I add.

As I mentioned in a previous post on [how to make a tweet go viral](https://edlatimore.com/how-to-make-a-tweet-go-viral/), there are three ways to offer value:

* Educate
* Entertain
* Inspire

Twitter is the perfect platform to do all three, 140 characters at a time. As it pertains to the idea of giving value, I believe that you’re either causing problems, solving problems, or distracting people from their problems.

Causing problems is the exact opposite of delivering value. It is taking value. Even when delving into potentially polarizing topics, I try to avoid discussing them in ways that stir divisiveness and arguing.

Instead, I use my 140-plus characters to educate, entertain, and inspire people in a way that solves problems and distracts people from their problems.

I try to focus on making people laugh, providing insights, and writing good content. This ensures that people are interested in following, connecting, and working with me. I make sure I include humor along with my insights. I feel like Twitter is a better place when people laugh *and* get a dose of interesting insight and perspective. Adding humor makes you more likely to get a retweet, which opens you up to more people to network with.

## 2\. Communicate with people through DMs

Direct Messages (DMs) are far more effective than people give them credit for. Leave your DMs open so that everyone who wants to connect with you is able to.

Check your DM inbox regularly to make sure you didn’t overlook any messages, especially from people who aren’t following you. Make sure your notifications are set up to alert and remind you of any messages.

When people see you tweeting regularly, commenting on people’s tweets, and overall staying on brand with the value you’re trying to create, plenty of opportunities can come your way.

Ignore the noise of Twitter and think of it in the same vein as LinkedIn and other professional social networks.

I’ve gotten several high-paying speaking gigs and a major publishing deal because of people reaching out to me on Twitter via direct messages. Many of the major podcasts I’ve been on have been because people found me on Twitter.

I try my best to reply to everyone who comments or leaves a DM. You never know when you might get a message from someone with similar interests.

## 3\. Learn the platform

Most people toy around with Twitter, send a few tweets, and then give up when nothing happens. You can’t be lazy about networking on Twitter.

Learn the platform and keep up with the changes that are implemented from time to time. Developing hashtag strategies, optimizing your Twitter feed, jumping on Twitter chats, and adjusting the settings on your Twitter account can keep you organized and make sure your message is delivered to the world loud and clear.

Knowing how the platform works will help you use Twitter more effectively, which also makes you a more effective networker.

## 4\. Guard your image

It’s shocking, but no longer surprising to hear stories of people getting fired for being hateful and inflammatory on Twitter. It’s as though people think that because they’re saying things from behind a screen, real life ceases to exist.

I go out of my way to treat everyone with respect on Twitter, and to be engaging. Even when trolls pop up, the block button is my best friend.

This strategy is probably the most important one.

I’d rather block someone than argue with them or speak in a disrespectful way to them. I try to stop and think that maybe that person is having a bad day, or misunderstood something that I said.

It could be anything, but it has served me better to operate in good faith and ignore any hate that I get than to ever engage with it.

I don’t know if this has ever directly gotten me any deals or connections, but I know that people can see your conversations. I want to make sure that I don’t say anything that could reflect poorly on me. I want to always put my best foot forward.

Think of yourself as a small business. Express yourself however you see fit, but recognize that the millions of potential Twitter followers and business partners get a say. If you wouldn’t express yourself a certain way in person, don’t do it on Twitter.

## Wrapping up – How to network on Twitter

You can essentially boil my Twitter networking strategy down to the same networking concepts I apply offline.

Develop a skill. Deliver value. Demonstrate that value.

As long as you’re a decent human being, you’ll reach a large number of people on Twitter that will resonate with you. Many of these people are well-connected influencers and will want to do business with you in some form or fashion.

Use Twitter this way and you can change your life in ways you couldn’t imagine.
