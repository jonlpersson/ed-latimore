      **Pornhub recently compiled a survey about pornography users' viewing

      habits from 2008-2017…**



      * In 2008, 134 hours of pornography were uploaded to Pornhub. In 2017, it

      was 476,291 hours.


      * In 2008, Pornhub saw *1 million* daily visitors to the site. In 2017,

      **75 million daily visitors**.



      Considering this is just one of the countless thousands of free online

      porn sites, the porn industry appears to be doing well…



      **But out of the growth of internet porn has also come a vast number of

      guys whose lives have been damaged by porn addiction.**



      Online communities, forums, and support groups like r/nofap on Reddit are

      popping up everywhere. For the first time ever, men all over the world are

      realizing that even though pornography is fun in the short term, there are

      debilitating long-term consequences to heavy porn use and chronic

      masturbation.



      For example:



      * In 2012, [Swiss researchers

      found](https://www.brainblogger.com/2017/10/06/excessive-porn-consumption-can-cause-erectile-dysfunction-myth-or-truth/){:

      target="_blank"} Erectile Dysfunction (ED) rates of 30% in 18 to 24

      year-old Swiss men.


      * In 2013, [Italian researchers

      found](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095&#40;15&#41;30428-8/fulltext){:

      target="_blank"} that 1 in 4 men under the age of forty have reported some

      type of erectile dysfunction.



      A few decades ago, young men having performance problems was *unheard of.*



      Now, thanks to the abundance of free pornographic content available,

      erectile dysfunction is only the tip of the problem (pun intended).



      Chronic internet pornography use and excessive masturbation can also lead

      to…



      * Destroyed marriages and relationships


      * Disturbing fetishes and sex addictions


      * Mental health problems like depression and anxiety


      * Crippling social anxiety and inability to talk to girls


      * Chronic lethargy and lack of motivation


      * Guilt and shame that follows you like a shadow



      Thankfully, all of this is fixable…



      ## How to stop watching porn and fix your sex life



      You’re here because you’re suspicious about your porn habit. You think you

      might have a problem with porn, but you aren’t sure.



      Here’s an easy test…



      Does the following sound at all like you?



      1. You’re spending money on porn


      2. You’re depressed


      3. Your d\*ck doesn’t work


      4. Your porn taste has escalated


      5. You have brain fog and low energy


      6. You're choosing porn instead of girls in real life


      7. You can’t stop watching porn despite the consequences



      If you–or a loved one–are suffering from one or more of the 7 major

      effects of porn addiction, then you’re in the right place.



      **I used to be so addicted to porn that I couldn't go more than a few

      hours without fapping.** I wasn't sure I'd ever escape the gravitational

      pull of my pornography addiction.



      However, thanks to what I share in this course, my hands and my conscience

      are finally clean.



      The shame. The depression. The ED. The late-night hentai sessions. The low

      energy.



      **All of this can be undone.** You might have developed this bad habit

      from a young age, but you have the power to undo it as well.



      At least you recognize the problem and plan to do something about it. In

      my experience dealing with both alcohol and porn addiction, admitting that

      you have a problem is the first step in overcoming it.



      With the information and strategies provided in *Dick Detox: the ultimate

      guide to quitting porn*, you can finally conquer the porn habit and…



      * Rewire your brain to crave real sex rather than digital daydreams


      * Develop healthy relationships with real human beings


      * Release guilt and fear caused by a shameful browser history


      * Heal your brain's dopamine reward center for better motivation and focus


      * Crush cravings on the spot by replacing porn with healthier alternatives


      * Develop absolute self-control without the need for an accountability

      partner


      * Dramatically improve your sex life whether you are single or married


      * Improve your self-esteem knowing you belong to the minority of men who

      live porn free


      * And so much more



      Once you understand the processes that are *keeping* you addicted, you can

      remove the problem at the root (FOREVER).



      What are you waiting for?
