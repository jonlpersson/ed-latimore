      One of my favorite metaphors for life is boxing, "The hurt business," as
      Mike Tyson once called it, is the business of causing pain, enduring it,
      and trying to emerge victorious.


      If a fight is violent enough, even the winner will take enough damage to
      feel like they've lost.

      ***"It ain't about how hard you can hit. It's about how hard you can get
      hit and keep going."&nbsp;***


      ***\- Rocky Balboa***


      In that one line, Rocky, the fictional heavyweight champion of the world,
      makes a powerful commentary about the nature of boxing and the essence of
      life:


      Things happen that will keep you from achieving what you want. The ability
      to survive setbacks is what sets you up for success in life.
