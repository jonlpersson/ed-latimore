      One of my favorite metaphors for life is boxing, "The hurt business," as
      Mike Tyson once called it, is the business of causing pain, enduring it,
      and trying to emerge victorious.


      If a fight is violent enough, even the winner will take enough damage to
      feel like they've lost.

      ***"It ain't about how hard you can hit. It's about how hard you can get
      hit and keep going."&nbsp;***


      ***\- Rocky Balboa***


      In that one line, Rocky, the fictional heavyweight champion of the world,
      makes a powerful commentary about the nature of boxing and the essence of
      life:


      Things happen that will keep you from achieving what you want. The ability
      to survive setbacks is what sets you up for success in life.


      Throughout my amateur and professional career, I've had over 80 fights
      against other trained men whose only intent was to hurt me.


      I've been hit way more times than I've hit.


      I've been hurt.<br>I've been stopped.<br>I've been disappointed.<br>I've
      been "robbed" (A fighter is "robbed" when they obviously won a fight, but
      because they didn't win by knockout, the bout is decided by the judge's
      decision, and they lose.)


      But despite all this, I won a state title (2011 Pennsylvania Golden Gloves
      3-201 lbs+) and a national title (2011 National PAL 201+ lbs). But most
      importantly, I kept fighting and won way more fights than I lost.


      This aligns perfectly with my life.


      Throughout my 38 years, I've been beaten, betrayed, abandoned,
      disappointed, and robbed (literally).


      I've lost friends, battled addiction, come back from poverty, and had my
      heart broken before it was stomped on.


      Despite this, I've made friendships that will last a lifetime, gotten
      sober while helping others do the same, helped many, and even saved a few
      lives.


      My life isn't perfect. It's a work in progress.&nbsp;


      The last battle I fought won't be the last one because I understand that
      part of life is the struggle. It's always going to be a fight. It will
      knock you down no matter how hard you train for it.


      <u><strong>But will you get back up?</strong></u>




      This email course contains 20 short lessons from the hurt business of life
      and boxing.&nbsp;


      These are observations I took from my time in boxing that also apply to
      the various challenges I faced in my life, like battling alcoholism and
      growing up in public housing raised without my father around.


      I hope that with these lessons, you'll be better able to make it through
      any personal hardships, trials, or tribulations that you are facing.&nbsp;


      If you don't have any immediate challenges, I hope this guide helps you
      become the most mentally tough, antifragile version of yourself.


      Life is the hurt business.&nbsp;


      Stop hoping that it will stop hurting and, instead, get tougher and learn
      to fight back. Eventually, you'll get stronger and better. Only then will
      things become easier.


      The rest is up to you.
