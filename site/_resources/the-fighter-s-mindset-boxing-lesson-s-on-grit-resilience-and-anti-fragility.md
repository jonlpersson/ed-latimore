      One of my favorite metaphors for life is boxing, "The hurt business," as
      Mike Tyson once called it, is the business of causing pain and enduring
      it, all while trying to emerge victorious.


      If a fight is violent enough, even the winner will take so much damage
      they'll feel like they've lost.

      ***"It ain't about how hard you can hit. It's about how hard you can get
      hit and keep going."&nbsp;***


      ***\- Rocky Balboa***


      In that one line, Rocky Balboa, the fictional heavyweight champion of the
      world, makes a powerful commentary on the nature of boxing AND the essence
      of life:


      **Things happen that will keep you from achieving what you want. The
      ability to survive setbacks is what sets you up for success in life.**


      Throughout my amateur and professional boxing career, I've had over 80
      fights against other trained men whose only intent was to hurt me.


      I've been hit *way* more times than I've hit.


      I've been hurt.I've been stopped.I've been disappointed.I've been "robbed"
      (A fighter is "robbed" when they obviously won a fight, but because they
      didn't win by knockout, the bout is decided by the judge's decision, and
      they lose.)


      But despite all this, I won a state title (2011 Pennsylvania Golden Gloves
      201 lbs+) and a national title (2011 National PAL 201+ lbs) and went on to
      have a professional career of 13-1-1.


      But most importantly, I kept fighting and won way more fights than I lost.


      **This aligns perfectly with the rest of my life.**


      I've been beaten, betrayed, abandoned, disappointed, and robbed
      (literally).


      I've lost friends, battled addiction, and had my heart broken before it
      was stomped on.


      Throughout it all,&nbsp; I made friendships that will last a lifetime, got
      sober while helping others do the same, and even saved a few lives.


      My life isn't perfect. It's a work in progress.&nbsp;


      The last battle I fought won't be the last one because part of life is the
      struggle. It's always going to be a fight. It will knock you down no
      matter how hard you train for it.


      **But will you get back up?**


      This email course contains 20 short lessons from the hurt business of life
      and boxing.&nbsp;


      These are observations from boxing that also apply to the various
      challenges I faced in my life, like battling alcoholism and growing up in
      public housing raised without my father around.


      I hope that with these lessons, you'll be better able to overcome any
      personal hardships, trials, or tribulations you face.&nbsp;


      If you don't have any immediate challenges, I hope this guide helps you
      become the most mentally tough, antifragile version of yourself.


      Life is the hurt business.&nbsp;


      Stop hoping that it will stop hurting and, instead, get tougher and learn
      to fight back. Eventually, you'll get stronger and better. Only then will
      things become easier.


      The rest is up to you.
