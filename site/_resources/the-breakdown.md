      In this free guide, I break down 8 of my highest performing tweets, as measured by their impressions (how many people potentially saw the tweet) and engagement (how many people interacted with it).

      I will explain my thinking behind the creation of the tweet, why the tweet did so well, and what I could have done better.I’ve chosen this approach because after I wrote “Engagement is The New Cocaine” and put together “The Twitter Growth Engine”, I realized something: effective writing is challenging to teach without constant feedback.

      So I created this guide for you to see the principles at play.
