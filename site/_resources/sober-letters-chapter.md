      ## The day I hit my breaking point


      After yet another embarrassing night, I’d had enough.


      I realized that I hated this version of myself.


      There I was, a grown-ass man acting like a complete fool because of my
      drinking.


      How humiliating! How many more times would I have to feel guilty about my
      lack of control?


      How many more times was I going to feel embarrassed after hearing how I
      acted the night before?


      How many more times was I going to wake up without being able to remember
      what the hell I’d done?


      ## What every drinker dreads


      I will tell you exactly how I felt before I quit drinking because these
      feelings are common.


      A part of you will feel scared before you quit.


      You’ll wonder if people will see you differently.


      Will they think you’re weak? Reckless? Untrustworthy?


      Maybe even love you less? You worry about how people will react when you
      say, “I don’t drink anymore.”


      (Pro-tip: that’s not *your* problem—it’s *theirs*.)


      There’s also this consistent feeling in the pit of your stomach that all
      the damage you’ve done while drunk is irreparable… and unforgivable.


      Personally, I hated that feeling of letting people down, especially my
      mother and my friends.


      Then there’s that fear of isolation.


      Nobody likes losing their friends and avoiding certain places because you
      know people will be drinking.

      ## Where many alcoholics fail


      Believe me when I say I tried *all* the popular methods to quit drinking:


      * I isolated myself

      * I joined Alcoholics Anonymous

      * I poured out all of my alcohol

      * I told my friends I wasn't drinking (and hoped they'd support me)


      And nothing changed until I admitted that I was terrified *and* willing to
      change my bad habits.


      Only then could I move forward.


      This “lightbulb moment” helped me decide who I wanted to be and what it
      would take to get there.


      So after many failed attempts, I figured out a way to deal with my
      drinking, and my life’s been better ever since.

      ## The book that will change your life


      *Sober Letters to My Drunken Self* is my most personal book yet and I
      believe it has the potential to make a real difference in the world.


      When you read *Sober Letters to My Drunken Self*, you’ll discover:


      * The \#1 question you need to ask yourself *before* you quit drinking

      * The surprising connection between the choices you make when you’re sober
      and the destructive thoughts you have when intoxicated

      * The 3 most powerful things you absolutely need so you can stop drinking
      (hint: it’s not a sponsor)

      * Why a long-term plan to quit drinking will set you up to fail (and what
      to do instead)

      * The counterintuitive way to turn your weaknesses into strengths (I’ll
      share my personal story)

      * Can you have fun… sober? You might think it’s impossible, but it’s not!
      I’ll show you how and why you don’t need alcohol to have fun.

      * Every heavy drinker has feelings of guilt and regret. You’ll discover
      the specific methods I’ve used to process these powerful emotions so you
      can have a positive, healthy future.
