          when this writer and former Heavyweight pro boxer learned to bet on
          himself, he found self-respect and the capability to dictate his own
          future.

          Ed's style of communication is direct, and always from a place of
          'Skin-in-the-game,' meaning he speaks about what he personally has
          involvement in, and not that which he doesn't.
