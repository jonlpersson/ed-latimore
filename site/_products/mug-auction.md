  text: >-
    This sturdy ceramic mug bears my iconic “Coffee So Black” mark on the front,
    paired with one of my popular Twitter jokes on the back: “Coffee so black
    you can only buy it at auction,” liked and retweeted by thousands. The mug
    has a glossy finish and the print retains its quality even when dishwashed
    and microwaved.
