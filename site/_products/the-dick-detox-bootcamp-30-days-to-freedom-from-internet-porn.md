      Hey guys\!\!


      21 days+now\!\! Extremely committed and decided. I will never fall to my
      old self because the benefits are tremendous. I won't trick my brain into
      that dopamine trap.


      Good sleep, improved self-confidence, and now higher sex drive. Was with
      my girl yesterday and we had an intense make-out session. I felt like a
      man and in control.


      I am starting to feel horny at night or early waking up but I see those as
      good signs. Implemented breath work and meditation.<br><br>Guys keep at it

      The Porn Pandemic&nbsp;


      * The *Journal of Sex Research* reports that 91.5% of men have watched
      porn at least once in the last month
      ([source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2018.1532488?journalCode=hjsr20))&nbsp;

      * According to data from the SEMrush Traffic Analytics tool, as of April
      2022 porn sites received more website traffic in the U.S. than Twitter,
      Instagram, Netflix, Pinterest, and LinkedIn combined.
      ([source](https://www.semrush.com/blog/most-visited-websites/))


      * SimilarWeb, a website metric tracking service, reports that **Xvideos
      alone received over 3 BILLION visits in the last 30 days.** That’s for
      only **ONE** porn site—there are ***SEVERAL \*\**othersthat boast similar
      numbers.&nbsp;***Keep in mind that there are only 4 billion guys on the
      planet\!*\*\*
  - _id: block_rich_text
    alignment: center
    text_markdown: >-
      But these numbers aren’t surprising…


      **Porn—specifically high-speed, streaming, internet porn—is an EXTREMELY
      addictive drug**. That’s because this type of porn has a trifecta of
      traits that makes it easy to get hooked on and nearly impossible to quit:


      * **Accessibility.** Almost everyone has access to high-speed internet,
      either on their smartphone or computer at home.

      * **Anonymity.** No one has to know you watch porn unless you get caught.

      * **Affordability.** It’s free\!&nbsp;


      But where porn differs from other addictive substances is WHY guys get
      hooked. People usually get hooked on drugs and booze as a coping mechanism
      for trauma and other issues, but you don’t need to be hurting inside for
      porn to trap you.


      Porn’s appeal is simple: Orgasms feel good. The urge to meet a woman and
      procreate is arguably the most powerful drive in the world. Internet porn
      gives you the feeling of doing that WITHOUT facing risk, rejection, and
      potential embarrassment.


      **It seems like a great ride until you realize that everything comes with
      a cost…&nbsp;**


      Men all over the world are starting to realize that even though
      pornography is fun in the short term, **there are devastating long-term
      consequences.**


      **For example:&nbsp;**


      * A study led by [Dr. Peter Ueda](https://staff.ki.se/people/petjak) at
      the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden reported that **men are
      having way less sex**
      ([source](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/young-adults-especially-men-having-sex-less-frequently)).

      * In 2013, Italian researchers found that 1 in 4 men under the age of
      forty have reported some type of erectile dysfunction
      ([source](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095&#40;15&#41;30428-8/fulltext)).

      * Men under 40 are dealing with **sharp increases in delayed ejaculation,
      erectile dysfunction, low libido**, and overall dissatisfaction with sex
      ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039517/)).

      * Porn use can increase mental health problems like depression and anxiety
      ([source](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.613244/full))

      * People in a relationship who watch porn were more likely to break up in
      direct proportion to the frequency of their porn use
      ([source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/experimentations/201707/pornography-and-broken-relationships))

      * **Porn use can shrink parts of your brain** responsible for good
      decision making, motivation, and mood
      ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050060/))


      But you didn’t need a study to tell you any of this.&nbsp;


      You know it from your own experience, and that’s why you’re here…

      ## Introducing The Dick Detox Bootcamp


      **The Dick Detox Bootcamp is a 30-day intensive program hosted by Ed
      Latimore that will get you off of porn and your dating life back on track,
      even if you’ve been hooked since age 12**


      By combining the latest research on porn addiction, a decade of personal
      experience battling addiction, and a PRIVATE support network, the Dick
      Detox Bootcamp is the fastest and most effective way to quit porn anywhere
      on the internet.&nbsp;


      #### The 4-week Dick Detox program consists of:


      * **2 group calls per week hosted by Ed Latimore on Zoom.**&nbsp;You’ll
      receive direct access to me as I share my experiences and strategies for
      battling addiction every week. This is NOT a webinar but a live,
      interactive call with me and the other clients.&nbsp;

      * **Worksheets and homework assignments.** Every call comes with both live
      assignments to do on the call and a homework assignment for you to
      complete on your own to make sure the lessons stick and apply to your
      life.&nbsp;

      * **Lifetime access to our private group hosted in Circle.** We have a
      private community where members can log their progress, post content,
      share victories, and receive support and feedback. You’ll keep your access
      even after the 30 days are over.

      * **Lifetime Whatsapp group access.** Every member is added to a private
      Whatsapp group immediately upon signing up where you can receive *instant*
      support and feedback as you battle porn temptations. This alone has helped
      numerous guys hit the brakes before crashing and ruining their progress.

      * **A band of brothers.** In addition to your coaches, the guys in the
      Dick Detox group are your core support group for the next 30 days and
      beyond. Anyone who has beaten an addiction knows that a good support group
      is the most important step in recovery. Connections made within the group
      often last for years\!

      * **Complete privacy.** The only guys who will know anything about your
      porn use are those who are in the group for the same reason. Everything
      shared within the group is 100% confidential.


      I know many of you guys are leading busy lives. Quitting porn is a
      priority, but you still have a life to live…


      That’s why I made this program as simple as possible. It will take less
      than 3 hours of your time per week for **just 4 weeks**.&nbsp;


      After that, you’ll have the tools, skills, and network to stay away from
      porn for good.&nbsp;

      ## Course Syllabus


      ### Ed Latimore


      #### Week 1 Becoming better looking to make girls want to have sex with
      you


      It’s hard to get off porn if you don’t think you’ll ever have a chance
      with a real flesh and blood woman. The good news is that women are just as
      turned on by appearances as men, and they will make themselves more
      available to you if you follow some basic steps to enhance your physical
      appearance.


      There’s no such thing as an ugly man; only one who doesn’t try. Improving
      your appearance will not only make you more attractive to women, it will
      also increase the amount of respect you have for yourself.&nbsp;


      1. Body recomposition plan (nutrition, weight lifting, and body weight)

      2. Haircut recommendation and facial hair recommendation

      3. Basic grooming that makes a big difference (tongue scraping, skincare,
      flossing, moisturizing)

      4. Clothing and shoe selection on a budget

      5. Picking out cologne


      #### Week 2 Hobbies to make you more attractive


      You’re having trouble stepping away from porn because it’s alluring and
      hits all the buttons to make you addicted. Well not only is porn a bad
      habit on its own, but it’s also preventing you from developing interesting
      hobbies to make you attractive to women.&nbsp;


      It’s not enough to stop a bad habit—we have to replace it with a healthy
      one.&nbsp; But instead of telling you exactly which hobbies to do, I’ll
      give you a simple rubric for identifying if a hobby will make you more
      attractive, make you a better person, and keep you off of porn.


      1. The characteristics of a bad hobby

      2. What all good hobbies have in common

      3. How to figure out what type of hobby is best for you without wasting
      time

      4. Which hobbies do women find the most attractive and why

      5. How to lean on your hobby to replace your porn hobby


      #### Week 3 Preventative measures and combating cravings


      The easiest way to break your porn habit is to make it difficult to use
      porn. Learn how to porn-proof your lifestyle and technology. Getting this
      right is half the battle. In theory, just porn-proofing your life would
      indefinitely fix most of your issues with pornography, but there is more
      that we must do to detox your dick for good.


      No matter what we do, there will be situations where you can use. No
      proofing method is perfect and old habits die hard. This is where we
      employ the last-minute strategies that we develop to deal with porn
      cravings.


      1. Get private internet use as close to zero as possible. Easy if you live
      with people.

      2. Set up porn blocks and wipe browser history.

      3. Develop non-digital entertainment measures to keep you off the computer
      whenever possible

      4. Rearranging your workspace

      5. Removing digital triggers (sites and whatnot)


      #### Week 4 Camaraderie and accountability


      The program comes with an accountability group that you’re plugged into,
      but what about when the program ends? This will teach your accountability
      strategies so you can take these and continue to lean on your friends and
      nurture relationships to help you stay clean.&nbsp;


      1. Introducing the Skinner rats and we can learn from them

      2. Building accountability and openness with people in your life

      3. Courage to seek out people who support you

      4. Staying connected past the group


      ### Bonus Lesson: Sparking sex life with your wife


      It’s easier to fall into the porn trap if your wife doesn’t want to have
      sex with you or you don’t want to have sex with your wife. If it’s the
      former, the work in this bonus will show you how to rekindle the flame the
      right way. If you don’t want to have sex with her, then we’ll deal with
      the most reasons you don’t want to and come up with a solution. This will
      almost certainly involve hard conversations that you’ve been putting off
      with yourself or her, and now is the time to do it.


      1. Be honest? Would you fuck you? Why or why not (call bullshit session)

      2. Men are either fucking up with the physical, emotional, or “financial”
      responsibility. Which one are you? (Deep dive group session)

      3. Devising a 30-day plan to immediately change the home dynamic to be
      more conducive to sex.

      4. If the issue is with you not wanting to sleep with her, why? 90% of the
      time, this is going to be purely physical


      ### **Who the course isn’t for**


      If you can’t have premarital sex, this program can’t work for you. I’m not
      saying that you have to go get laid tonight, but if your lifestyle/culture
      specifically forbids sex outside of wedlock—but you’re a porn addict—then
      you’ve got other issues that you need to deal with that will not be
      covered in this program.&nbsp;


      ### Regan Jacklin


      #### Week 1: Overcome the instant gratification trap by becoming a man of
      purpose&nbsp;


      Humans have deeply ingrained needs. If we don’t satisfy these needs
      naturally through positive habits and goals, we will need to satisfy them
      unnaturally with porn. Whether your goal is to get a girlfriend, start
      your own business, be a better parent or spouse, or get right with God,
      **this module will help you identify what is truly important to you and
      give you a tangible plan to begin moving towards it.**&nbsp;


      You’ll discover how you aren’t giving something up by quitting porn but
      how you’ve actually been forfeiting what is important to you through your
      porn use.


      1. Get clear and excited about what a life free from porn has in store for
      you

      2. Identify how porn is actually causing you more pain than pleasure&nbsp;

      3. Understand why your brain gets so hooked on something so harmful

      4. Discover cheat codes to blast through any withdrawals and help your
      brain heal ASAP

      5. Learn how one single neurochemical in your brain can be your superpower
      or keep you enslaved and how porn hijacks it every time.


      #### Week 2: Discovering the dark side of pornography&nbsp;


      **Deep down, something inside of you*****knows *****porn is immoral,
      nasty, and degrading.** But unlike other hard drugs, no one taught us
      about the damaging effects of porn. This module will confirm your
      suspicions and peel back the curtain, showing the latest research on
      porn’s harmful effects.


      When you can see porn for what it *really* is, you’ll develop a natural
      and visceral aversion to it. This is the only way to destroy cravings over
      the long term.&nbsp;


      Discover:&nbsp;


      1. How the porn industry is worse than you ever imagined.

      2. How porn is secretly the worst of all gateway drugs and opens the door
      for countless other bad habits.

      3. How porn can cause mental health problems, physical performance
      problems, emotional intimacy problems, and spiritual integrity problems.

      4. The danger of tolerance and where it can lead (relying on dangerous
      fetishes like child porn, cartoon porn, gang, rape, etc to get that
      ‘rush’).&nbsp;

      5. How to get off the moving train before virtual reality and robotics
      take porn to infinity and beyond (this shift will be bigger than jumping
      from playboys to high-speed internet porn\!)


      #### Week 3: Managing stress, boredom, and other difficult emotions
      without porn&nbsp;


      The only “negative” side effect of quitting porn is that you’ll be alone
      with your thoughts and emotions for the first time. Getting off porn
      forces you to confront whatever difficult facts or emotions you were
      hiding from. The only reason you haven’t quit porn already is because you
      haven’t been willing to face something.


      Many porn users don’t think they have a substance problem because they
      don’t drink alcohol or do drugs. But they use porn the same way any other
      addict does--to cope with their stresses, escape them, or fulfill an unmet
      need. In this module, you’ll learn why most guys don’t use porn because
      they have a high sex drive like they love to tell themselves but instead
      use porn to self-medicate for something. And you’ll learn healthier ways
      to cope without crashing.


      Here’s what we’ll cover:&nbsp;


      1. Identify which emotions you struggle with and explore healthier ways to
      deal with them

      2. Discover your subconscious fears around giving up porn

      3. Handle life’s ups and downs without a chemical crutch

      4. Stop using sex as a coping mechanism


      #### Week 4 Long-term tools for self-mastery and sustainable ‘sobriety’


      The threat of coming across porn never ends. No matter how well you
      shelter yourself, there’s always a chance of being exposed again. Even the
      best of us still face temptations after months or years of abstinence.
      This module will help you stay diligent over the long term even when your
      recovery is no longer your primary focus in life.&nbsp;


      1. Plan ahead of time how you will handle unexpected exposure

      2. Avoid relapses and bounce back quickly if you do have a setback

      3. Discover other habits that make sobriety harder and others that make it
      easier

      4. Easily remember why you started this journey months and years down the
      road&nbsp;

      5. Tips on effective journaling, meditation practices, dopamine fasting,
      breathwork, and more)

      Frequently Asked Questions


      ### What are the calls like?


      Each call is 60-90 minutes. Half of that time will be spent teaching you
      the science and strategies for overcoming porn. On most calls, there will
      also be 1 or 2 exercises to do live. We will always leave time for
      discussion for anyone who has questions or wants to engage further with
      the ideas. Lastly, during each call you will be given your homework
      assignment which usually takes 10-20 minutes (we then open up the next
      call by going over this assignment).


      ### How much time will be required of me?&nbsp;


      The calls are 60-90 minutes, twice per week, for 4 weeks. There will also
      be about 20 minutes worth of homework that is recommended you do in
      between calls. Overall, this course will take you 2-4 hours per week for 4
      weeks which means you can expect to break your addiction in roughly 10
      hours. If you choose, you can also spend much more time in the community
      groups as well.


      ### What results can I expect after the 4 weeks?


      First, you’ll have 30 days off of porn. If you’re like most guys, that’s a
      huge achievement by itself. You’ll also be armed with the strategies and
      habits to keep that streak alive, as well as an active group to help you
      remain accountable.&nbsp;


      You will have new hobbies and habits that increase your self-esteem and
      sexual marketplace value. Additionally, you can expect higher energy, sex
      drive, erection quality, and zest for life. Lastly, you’ll have the
      confidence and hope of knowing you are on the right path, and each day,
      month, and year will yield better mental, physical, and spiritual health.


      ### Is my involvement private?&nbsp;


      Public involvement is optional. On the zoom calls, you have to show your
      face or use your name. If you want to remain private, the only people who
      will know your identity are Ed and Regan, as they have to process your
      payment information. Otherwise, your level of public involvement is
      totally optional.&nbsp;


      ### What if I can’t make the live calls?


      All calls are recorded so you can rewatch anything you miss. You will have
      these replays to rewatch forever. The lessons taught on every call will
      also be transcribed so you can read the lessons presented. All homework
      will also be made available with instructions in the circle group.


      ### Is this for single guys or those in a committed relationship?


      Both. We want to see you win with women, whether you are in a relationship
      or still on the hunt.&nbsp;


      ### What happens once I enroll?&nbsp;


      Once you enroll, you will immediately receive instructions to get set up
      in the Whatsapp and Circle groups where you can get connected with the
      other members. You will receive an introductory video explaining how
      everything works and a brief overview of the strategies we are going to be
      covering (like the spark notes version so you can get started right away).
      Within 48 hours of joining, we will have our first call.&nbsp;


      ### What if I can’t afford it?


      We do offer the plan at two payments of $650 if the $1000 is too much
      upfront. We will also run other enrolments in the future. Start putting
      money aside now and treat your porn addiction as something serious.


      ### Why not just look up this information online for free?


      If information was all success took, everyone would be rich and ripped.
      When choosing a coach, you are paying for their years of experience with
      the subject, as well as the interactive and private *accountability
      community* they organize so all you have to do is show up. Ed Latimore and
      Regan Jacklin have spent *years* organizing and perfecting this system.
      The amount of research you’d have to do would take you years compared to
      just 4 weeks with us.&nbsp;


      ### Is this a religious group?


      There are no religious affiliations with this group. However, many choose
      to quit porn due to their faith so we often see many guys looking to
      enhance their spiritual life.&nbsp;


      # Ultimately, it’s not about porn


      Doing a dick detox is NOT just about quitting porn…


      **It’s about facing your fears, changing your life, and finally getting
      right where you’re wrong.**


      Using porn to escape from your problems only keeps you stuck on the
      hedonistic treadmill of bullshit.


      Instead of getting therapy, you watch more porn…


      Instead of making new friends, you watch more porn…


      Instead of doing anything meaningful to improve your life to get a real
      woman, you watch more porn…


      Unlike other groups or programs that have absurdly low success rates, **we
      teach you how to build****a life you want instead of escaping into digital
      fantasy.&nbsp;**


      We teach you how to get what you got from porn without resorting to it


      Because here’s the truth:&nbsp;


      ***Just*** quitting porn won’t change your life if you’re still alone, out
      of shape, and bored with your life.&nbsp;


      But with the live coaching, private support groups, and community provided
      in *Dick Detox,* you can finally conquer the porn habit and…


      * Rewire your brain to crave real sex rather than digital daydreams

      * Dramatically improve your sex life whether you are single or married

      * Release guilt and fear caused by a shameful browser history&nbsp;

      * Heal your brain’s reward centers for better motivation, focus, and
      happiness

      * Crush cravings on the spot by replacing porn with healthier alternatives

      * Eliminate social anxiety and develop healthy relationships with real
      human beings

      * Learn to live in alignment with your core values and become a man of
      integrity

      * Identify your most fulfilling goals and cultivate the habits and energy
      required to make them a reality&nbsp;

      * Improve your self-esteem knowing you belong to the minority of men who
