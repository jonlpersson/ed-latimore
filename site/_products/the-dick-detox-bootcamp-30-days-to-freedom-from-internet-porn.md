      Hey guys\!\!


      21 days+now\!\! Extremely committed and decided. I will never fall to my
      old self because the benefits are tremendous. I won't trick my brain into
      that dopamine trap.


      Good sleep, improved self-confidence, and now higher sex drive. Was with
      my girl yesterday and we had an intense make-out session. I felt like a
      man and in control.


      I am starting to feel horny at night or early waking up but I see those as
      good signs. Implemented breath work and meditation.<br><br>Guys keep at it

      The Porn Pandemic&nbsp;


      * The *Journal of Sex Research* reports that 91.5% of men have watched
      porn at least once in the last month
      ([source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2018.1532488?journalCode=hjsr20))&nbsp;

      * According to data from the SEMrush Traffic Analytics tool, as of April
      2022 porn sites received more website traffic in the U.S. than Twitter,
      Instagram, Netflix, Pinterest, and LinkedIn combined.
      ([source](https://www.semrush.com/blog/most-visited-websites/))


      * SimilarWeb, a website metric tracking service, reports that **Xvideos
      alone received over 3 BILLION visits in the last 30 days.** That’s for
      only **ONE** porn site—there are ***SEVERAL \*\**othersthat boast similar
      numbers.&nbsp;***Keep in mind that there are only 4 billion guys on the
      planet\!*\*\*

      But these numbers aren’t surprising…


      **Porn—specifically high-speed, streaming, internet porn—is an EXTREMELY
      addictive drug**. That’s because this type of porn has a trifecta of
      traits that makes it easy to get hooked on and nearly impossible to quit:


      * **Accessibility.** Almost everyone has access to high-speed internet,
      either on their smartphone or computer at home.

      * **Anonymity.** No one has to know you watch porn unless you get caught.

      * **Affordability.** It’s free\!&nbsp;


      But where porn differs from other addictive substances is WHY guys get
      hooked. People usually get hooked on drugs and booze as a coping mechanism
      for trauma and other issues, but you don’t need to be hurting inside for
      porn to trap you.


      Porn’s appeal is simple: Orgasms feel good. The urge to meet a woman and
      procreate is arguably the most powerful drive in the world. Internet porn
      gives you the feeling of doing that WITHOUT facing risk, rejection, and
      potential embarrassment.


      **It seems like a great ride until you realize that everything comes with
      a cost…&nbsp;**


      Men all over the world are starting to realize that even though
      pornography is fun in the short term, **there are devastating long-term
      consequences.**


      **For example:&nbsp;**


      * A study led by [Dr. Peter Ueda](https://staff.ki.se/people/petjak) at
      the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden reported that **men are
      having way less sex**
      ([source](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/young-adults-especially-men-having-sex-less-frequently)).

      * In 2013, Italian researchers found that 1 in 4 men under the age of
      forty have reported some type of erectile dysfunction
      ([source](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095&#40;15&#41;30428-8/fulltext)).

      * Men under 40 are dealing with **sharp increases in delayed ejaculation,
      erectile dysfunction, low libido**, and overall dissatisfaction with sex
      ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039517/)).

      * Porn use can increase mental health problems like depression and anxiety
      ([source](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.613244/full))

      * People in a relationship who watch porn were more likely to break up in
      direct proportion to the frequency of their porn use
      ([source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/experimentations/201707/pornography-and-broken-relationships))

      * **Porn use can shrink parts of your brain** responsible for good
      decision making, motivation, and mood
      ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050060/))


      But you didn’t need a study to tell you any of this.&nbsp;


      You know it from your own experience, and that’s why you’re here…
