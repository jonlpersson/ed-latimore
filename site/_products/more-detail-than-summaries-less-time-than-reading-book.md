      In my life, I’ve learned many things the hard way.


      In this book I break them down so that you can learn them the easy way and
      get more out of life. At one point I was stealing food just to eat and
      spent more time hung over than sober.


      From the streets, to the boxing gym, to the army, the physics lab and 4
      years of sobriety, I’ve developed true grit and the fighting mindset. **I
      teach it all in this book.**


      ## You will learn:


      * The real reason the ability to work hard is so highly valued.

      * How to identify where to invest your emotional energy for the greatest
      return

      * Why you can't afford to have low standards for anything you do or the
      company you keep.

      * The greatest source of motivation that's untapped by most.

      * Vital paradigm and mindset shifts that will allow you to get more out of
      life.

      * The difference between strategy and tactics and how to develop a mindset
      for both.

      * How to select the best people to have a relationship with and get the
      most out of it.
