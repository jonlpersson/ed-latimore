      I read every book listed and I'm continually adding to the notes. Rather
      than write a summary, I collected the most impactful, insightful passages
      from the back.


      Instead of getting the quotes with my sloppy interpretation, I simply pull
      the quotes and put them here for each book.


      Reading the whole book takes too long, but gives the most information.
      Summaries miss ideas and important wording based on what the summarizer
      thinks is important.


      Stoic Book Notes is the best of both worlds. The passages are not
      categorized. They're listed in the order they appear in the book.
