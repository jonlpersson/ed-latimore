      I read every book listed and I'm continually adding to the notes. Rather
      than write a summary, I collected the most impactful, insightful passages
      from the back.


      Instead of getting the quotes with my sloppy interpretation, I simply pull
      the quotes and put them here for each book.


      Reading the whole book takes too long, but gives the most information.
      Summaries miss ideas and important wording based on what the summarizer
      thinks is important.


      Stoic Book Notes is the best of both worlds. The passages are not
      categorized. They're listed in the order they appear in the book.

      - heading: '"On Killing" by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman'
        text: >-
          "On Killing" examines the psychological costs of war on soldiers asked
          to kill. He explores the innate human resistance to killing one's own
          species and how military training overcomes this through conditioning
          techniques.
      - heading: '"Thinking in Bets" By Annie Duke'
        text: >-
          Professional poker player Annie Duke outlines an approach to
          decision-making that she has developed through years of competing in
          high-stakes poker tournaments. Duke argues that in an uncertain world,
          where luck plays a role, we should view most decisions as bets rather
          than definitive statements or predictions. Instead of focusing too
          much on being right or wrong, we should think probabilistically,
          embrace uncertainty, and examine our beliefs and opinions as
          hypotheses to be tested.
      - heading: '"Man''s Search For Meaning" by Viktor Frankl'
        text: >-
          Viktor Frankl reflects on his experiences as a prisoner in Nazi
          concentration camps during World War II. He describes the
          psychological trauma and suffering inflicted by such extreme
          dehumanization, as well as his realization that finding purpose and
          meaning in life sustained those prisoners who managed to survive.
          Frankl concludes that meaning comes from dedication to a worthy cause
          or another person, allowing even severely suffering people to find the
          strength to endure and prevail.
      - heading: '"The Cure For Hate" by Tony McAleer'
        text: >-
          Tony McAleer recounts his years spent immersed in the 1980s and 1990s
          white supremacist movement, which provided an outlet for his rage and
          need for belonging in the wake of childhood trauma. Though convinced
          of the righteousness of the racist ideology at the time, his eventual
          disillusionment and hunger for personal growth led him to not only
          renounce hate and violence but become an educator and advocate for the
          disengagement of other extremists.
