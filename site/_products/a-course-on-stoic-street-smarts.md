      The ancient Stoic philosophers may seem an unlikely source of guidance for
      someone growing up in a tough inner-city neighborhood.


      Yet, while separated by eras and geography, the studious Stoic and the
      street-smart hustler have more in common than meets the eye. Both face
      tests of character and judgment. Both battle uncertainty and adversity.
      And both seek the wisdom to excel in a tough, turbulent world.


      One question that I get asked a lot in various interviews is “How did you
      find stoicism?” I didn’t find stoicism. Stoicism found me. My mother was
      loving, but emotionally manipulative and unstable. Outside of my home, I
      grew up in a dangerous public housing project. At home, I learned to be
      nonreactive to protect my sanity. In the streets, it helped me to protect
      my life.


      In this 3 month SMS course, we will explore surprising points of overlap
      between Stoic philosophy and modern "street smarts." They intersect on
      virtues like emotional resilience, adaptability, situational awareness,
      and effective communication.


      While their training grounds differ, both equip individuals to thrive
      amidst life's unpredictable challenges.
