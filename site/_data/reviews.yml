    heading: Gorilla Mind Smooth
    text: >
      Gorilla Mind Smooth is the stimulant-free successor of Gorilla Mind Rush
      for when I need that extra dose of concentration without the caffeine.
      While I’m sad to see Rush go, Smooth has provided a much smoother, less
      extreme energy while still providing intense focus without the jitters or
      crashes.


      It’s the best stim-free nootropic I’ve used.

      I got into CBD to help recover from concussions from boxing, but I
      discovered that it’s a fantastic for sleep. It also helps with clear
      thinking by making you calmer.

    heading: Wim Hof Breathing Method
    text: >
      Gaining control of my breathing and response to cold started as a vanity
      project, but it has also greatly benefitted my concentration and immune
      system. This is an easy 10 week course that will expose you to what’s
      physically possible if you put your mind to it.

    heading: Carbonshade Blue Light Blocking Glasses
    text: >
      These glasses make it easier to fall asleep because they block the
      disruptive blue wavelength that we’re overly exposed to as a result of
      prolonged screen time.

    heading: Gruvi Non-Alcoholic Beer
    text: >
      I’ve been sober since Dec 23rd, 2013. I like the taste of beer but I don’t
      enjoy how my behavior changes under the influence of alcohol. Gruvi is a
      delicious non-alcoholic beer with all of flavor and none of the
      foolishness. Use discount code ED10 for a 10% discount.

    heading: LMNT Electrolyte Powder
    text: >
      LMNT Recharge is a tasty electrolyte blend that replaces vital
      electrolytes without the sugars and questionable ingredients found in
      conventional sports drinks. My girlfriend actually keeps drinking my
      supply after our runs.
