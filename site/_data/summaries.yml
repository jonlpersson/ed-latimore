    Let's be real. Right now, you're struggling on Twitter.


    * Your follower count is at a stand still or worse, you're losing them

    * No one retweets your stuff

    * You're 1 suspension away from losing your account and being forced to
    start over


    Even though you see accounts of regular people having big growth and massive
    success, you think this "Twitter thing" just ain't worth it.


    The thing is, there's no better platform for making connections, generating
    traffic, and getting paid.


    In it, I give you the real game on how to grow your following organically,
    without resorting to cheap tactics that don't actually work. I show you
    exactly how to:


    * Make people share your tweets, even if they disagree

    * Be polarizing without trolling

    * How to make *any* topic highly engaging and addictive

    When I got sober, it was a terrifying time in my life, but I made it
    through. I wish that someone warned me about the emotional and mental
    challenges I'd face when I quit drinking.


    I wrote this book for people who want to get sober, but they don't have any
    support. I wrote this book to give guidance where there currently is none in
    our society. Whether you want to take a short break or give up the drinking
    forever, this book is for you. I wrote this book so that people can
    understand the mind and motivations of an alcoholic. Someone you love is
    suffering, they don't want to suffer anymore, and they need your help. I
    wrote this book to change a life and maybe to even save a few…

    Conquer mediocrity, kill complacency, feel better about yourself, and show
    up better to the rest of the world by learning how to dress intentionally.


    If you’ve decided you’re sick of not dressing like the man you know you are,
    that you’re tired of people not taking you seriously before you even have
    the chance to open your mouth, that you’re done dressing like an overgrown
    child, this program is for you.

    Stop wasting time and playing around. Learn to make your passion pay and
    leave that nasty job behind. Aren’t you sick and tired of being a “starving
    artist”?


    Don’t you hate:


    * Never standing out even though you’re a better writer than most content
    creators?

    * Not seeing your audience grow–or worse, shrink?

    * Working a job you hate because your passion doesn’t pay?

    * Seeing writers with half your talent go 10 times as far?


    Wouldn’t you like to get paid from your writing?


    It’s time to stop leaving money on the table\! It’s never been easier to
    make money as a writer…


    But there has also never been more competition.


    If you want to make money from your writing, **you need to be damn good** at
    it. Let me show you how to get the competitive edge.

  text_markdown: >
    I've seen numerous companies and websites, both large and small, fold
    because Google made a few tweaks to their algorithm and nobody at the
    company understood SEO well enough to both plan for the future and mitigate
    the risks.


    **Don't be like those websites!**


    This course is designed from the ground up to teach you how to get you more
    website traffic and how to protect against changes that would hurt your
    website.


    **Your website is your business and your business is your website.**


    More reward, less risk. Win-Win.


    So, 3 questions:


    **1\. Is organic traffic important to your business?**


    **2\. Would you like to have more organic traffic to your business?**


    **3\. Do believe that you should at least understand the basics of SEO?**


    If yes to all of the above…

    I don't know you, but I know you.


    I know that you're tired of feeling weak, being a victim, and having no
    control over the direction of your life.


    I know you because I was once you.


    I used to be stuck on the hedonistic treadmill of mediocrity. Always drunk,
    always broke, and always looking for the next piece of cheap entertainment
    and distraction.


    Then one day, I changed my entire life around.


    I took responsibility for my personal development and started living the
    best life I possibly could. I learned how to:


    * Live with purpose

    * Think with clarity

    * Face the my demons

    * Fix my finances


    Unlike a lot of other motivational gurus, I've been to the bottom and I
    clawed my way back out. It wasn't easy and I wasn't sure if I'd just become
    another statistic along the way, but I think I have made tremendous
    progress.


    I learned the hard way, but I can break it down so you can learn it the easy
    way…

    These are just the tip of the iceberg\! With a book this good, I there many
    more chunks of wisdom that I was able to collect from it.


    When I read a book, I collect the most useful, thought provoking, paradigm
    shifting, perspective expanding quotes and passages from them.


    This collection is constantly growing, but will center around anything that
    I think can make you better able to exist on this planet in harmony and
    productivity.

    and you hunger for new and different and ideas, check out my growing
    collection of quotes.

    - Increased motivation
    to be productive
    - More energy while working out
    - Decreased hunger during
    my fasting periods

    Gorilla Mind Smooth is the stimulant-free successor of Gorilla Mind Rush for
    when I need that extra dose of concentration without the caffeine. While I’m
    sad to see Rush go, Smooth has provided a much smoother, less extreme energy
    while still providing intense focus without the jitters or crashes.


    It’s the best stim-free nootropic I’ve used.
