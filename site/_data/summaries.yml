    Sobriety terrified me, but ruining my life scared me more. I did it, but I
    wish someone had warned me about the emotional challenges I'd face when I
    quit drinking.


    I wrote this book for people who want to get sober but don't have any
    support. Here's a free chapter "The 3 Things Keeping You From Getting
    Sober."

    Conquer mediocrity, kill complacency, feel better about yourself, and show
    up better to the rest of the world by learning how to dress intentionally.


    If you’ve decided you’re sick of not dressing like the man you know you are,
    that you’re tired of people not taking you seriously before you even have
    the chance to open your mouth, that you’re done dressing like an overgrown
    child, this program is for you.

    I don't know you, but I know you.


    I know that you're tired of feeling weak, being a victim, and having no
    control over the direction of your life.


    I know you because I was once you.


    I used to be stuck on the hedonistic treadmill of mediocrity. Always drunk,
    always broke, and always looking for the next piece of cheap entertainment
    and distraction.


    Then one day, I changed my entire life around.


    I took responsibility for my personal development and started living the
    best life I possibly could. I learned how to:


    * Live with purpose

    * Think with clarity

    * Face the my demons

    * Fix my finances


    Unlike a lot of other motivational gurus, I've been to the bottom and I
    clawed my way back out. It wasn't easy and I wasn't sure if I'd just become
    another statistic along the way, but I think I have made tremendous
    progress.


    I learned the hard way, but I can break it down so you can learn it the easy
    way…

  text_markdown: >-
    Tell me if any of this sounds like you. You:


    * Try to have one drink like a normal person, but you end up making a fool
    of yourself everytime you drink.

    * You worry that you don't know how to have just one drink like a normal
    person.

    * Don't know how to socialize and have fun without alcohol and you want a
    change.

    * Worry that you might hurt yourself or others the next time you drink.

    * Secretly are afraid that you drink too much but you can't leave the social
    life of alcohol behind.


    Even if you didn't see yourself in these statements, you know if alcohol is
    a problem that you're having trouble beating


    In my program Vicebreakers, I detail the strategies and tactics I used to
    \*finally\* quit booze after trying to put the bottle down for over.2 years.
    After numerous attempts and relapses, I cracked the code.


    12/22/13 was the last day I drank alcohol. My life has been uphill ever
    since.&nbsp;

    drinking habit, then check out Vicebreakers.

    Unfortunately, men are rarely taught the values of style, dressing well, and
    picking clothing that gets them massive attention.


    Too many guys are taught that it's effeminate or&nbsp; "gay" to care about
    their appearance but NOTHING could be further from the truth. Tanner Guzy is
    who I used to get my style right and who I wholeheartedly recommend for any
    guy looking to do the same.

    Learn the method I used to earn a physics degree, learn Spanish, and win a
    national boxing title
  text_markdown: >-
    * I was a terrible math student in high school who wrote off mathematics. I
    eventually overcame my difficulties and went on to earn a B.A. Physics with
    a minor in math

    * I pieced together the best works on the internet to teach myself Spanish
    as an adult

    * \*I didn’t start boxing until the very old age of 22, yet I went on to win
    a national championship, get a high-paying amateur sponsorship, and get
    signed by Roc Nation Sports as a profession.


    I’ve used this method to progress in mentally and physically demanding
    domains.


    While the specifics may differ, I believe that the general methods for
    learning are the same in all domains.


    This free e-book breaks down the most important techniques I’ve used for
    learning.
