  text_markdown: >-
    When I got sober, it was a terrifying time in my life, but I made it
    through. I wish that someone warned me about the emotional and mental
    challenges I'd face when I quit drinking.


    I wrote this book for people who want to get sober, but they don't have any
    support. I wrote this book to give guidance where there currently is none in
    our society. Whether you want to take a short break or give up the drinking
    forever, this book is for you. I wrote this book so that people can
    understand the mind and motivations of an alcoholic. Someone you love is
    suffering, they don't want to suffer anymore, and they need your help. I
    wrote this book to change a life and maybe to even save a few…

    up better to the rest of the world by learning how to dress intentionally.

  text_markdown: >-
    Stop wasting time and playing around. Learn to make your passion pay and
    leave that nasty job behind. Aren’t you sick and tired of being a “starving
    artist”?


    Don’t you hate:


    * Never standing out even though you’re a better writer than most content
    creators?

    * Not seeing your audience grow–or worse, shrink?

    * Working a job you hate because your passion doesn’t pay?

    * Seeing writers with half your talent go 10 times as far?


    Wouldn’t you like to get paid from your writing?


    It’s time to stop leaving money on the table\! It’s never been easier to
    make money as a writer…


    But there has also never been more competition.


    If you want to make money from your writing, **you need to be damn good** at
    it. Let me show you how to get the competitive edge.

    I don't know you, but I know you.


    I know that you're tired of feeling weak, being a victim, and having no
    control over the direction of your life.


    I know you because I was once you.


    I used to be stuck on the hedonistic treadmill of mediocrity. Always drunk,
    always broke, and always looking for the next piece of cheap entertainment
    and distraction.


    Then one day, I changed my entire life around.


    I took responsibility for my personal development and started living the
    best life I possibly could. I learned how to:


    * Live with purpose

    * Think with clarity

    * Face the my demons

    * Fix my finances


    Unlike a lot of other motivational gurus, I've been to the bottom and I
    clawed my way back out. It wasn't easy and I wasn't sure if I'd just become
    another statistic along the way, but I think I have made tremendous
    progress.


    I learned the hard way, but I can break it down so you can learn it the easy
    way…

    These are just the tip of the iceberg\! With a book this good, I there many
    more chunks of wisdom that I was able to collect from it.


    When I read a book, I collect the most useful, thought provoking, paradigm
    shifting, perspective expanding quotes and passages from them.


    This collection is constantly growing, but will center around anything that
    I think can make you better able to exist on this planet in harmony and
    productivity.


    If you're tired of everyone recommending the same old self-improvement books
    and you hunger for new and different and ideas, check out my growing
    collection of quotes.


    AND IT'S COMPLETELY FREE to be part of constantly growing hivemind of ideas,
    thoughts, and perspectives on books that everyone should be reading but are
    too caught up in what's trendy.

    Tell me if any of this sounds like you. You:


    * Try to have one drink like a normal person, but you end up making a fool
    of yourself everytime you drink.

    * You worry that you don't know how to have just one drink like a normal

    Gorilla Mind Smooth is the stimulant-free successor of Gorilla Mind Rush for
    when I need that extra dose of concentration without the caffeine. While I’m
    sad to see Rush go, Smooth has provided a much smoother, less extreme energy
    while still providing intense focus without the jitters or crashes.
