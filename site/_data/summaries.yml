    Sobriety terrified me, but ruining my life scared me more. I did it, but I
    wish someone had warned me about the emotional challenges I'd face when I
    quit drinking.


    I wrote this book for people who want to get sober but don't have any
    support. Here's a free chapter "The 3 Things Keeping You From Getting
    Sober."

    up better to the rest of the world by learning how to dress intentionally.

    the chance to open your mouth, that you’re done dressing like an overgrown
    child, this program is for you.

  text_markdown: >-
    Stop wasting time and playing around. Learn to make your passion pay and
    leave that nasty job behind. Aren’t you sick and tired of being a “starving
    artist”?


    Don’t you hate:


    * Never standing out even though you’re a better writer than most content
    creators?

    * Not seeing your audience grow–or worse, shrink?

    * Working a job you hate because your passion doesn’t pay?

    * Seeing writers with half your talent go 10 times as far?


    Wouldn’t you like to get paid from your writing?


    It’s time to stop leaving money on the table\! It’s never been easier to
    make money as a writer…


    But there has also never been more competition.


    If you want to make money from your writing, **you need to be damn good** at
    it. Let me show you how to get the competitive edge.

    I don't know you, but I know you.


    I know that you're tired of feeling weak, being a victim, and having no
    control over the direction of your life.


    I know you because I was once you.


    I used to be stuck on the hedonistic treadmill of mediocrity. Always drunk,
    always broke, and always looking for the next piece of cheap entertainment
    and distraction.


    Then one day, I changed my entire life around.


    I took responsibility for my personal development and started living the
    best life I possibly could. I learned how to:


    * Live with purpose

    * Think with clarity

    * Face the my demons

    * Fix my finances


    Unlike a lot of other motivational gurus, I've been to the bottom and I
    clawed my way back out. It wasn't easy and I wasn't sure if I'd just become
    another statistic along the way, but I think I have made tremendous
    progress.


    I learned the hard way, but I can break it down so you can learn it the easy
    way…

    Gorilla Mind Smooth is the stimulant-free successor of Gorilla Mind Rush for
    when I need that extra dose of concentration without the caffeine. While I’m
    sad to see Rush go, Smooth has provided a much smoother, less extreme energy
    while still providing intense focus without the jitters or crashes.


    It’s the best stim-free nootropic I’ve used.
