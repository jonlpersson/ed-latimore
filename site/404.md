      Actually, it’s probably my web designer’s bad. In any case, there’s something wrong with the link you just clicked on (error 404).

      I recommend reorienting yourself by going to [my home page](/). If you want, you can also let me know what happened by hitting me up [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/edlatimore/).
