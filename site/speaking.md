## Who is Ed Latimore and what are the experiences and lessons he teaches audiences&nbsp;

Ed Latimore is an American former professional heavyweight boxer and standout amateur super heavyweight boxer. Despite starting boxing at the late age of 22, he became the 2011 Pennsylvania State Golden Gloves super heavyweight champion, the National Police Athletic League super heavyweight champion, and silver medalist at the Ringside International Boxing Tournament.&nbsp;

As an amateur boxer, Ed Latimore holds notable victories over the 2012 super heavyweight Olympic representative and 2x world title challenger Dominic Breazeale and former IBF heavyweight world champion Charles Martin. He ended his amateur career with a peak USA Boxing ranking of \#4 in the United States with a record of 48-11.

As a professional heavyweight, Ed Latimore was promoted by Jay-Z’s sports promotion company, Roc Nation Sports, and was trained by Hall of Fame boxing coach Tom Yankello. He retired with a record of 13-1-1, with his only loss coming at the hands of Trey Lippe-Morrison, son of former WBA heavyweight champion Tommy Morrison.&nbsp;

Latimore credits the mindset he developed from boxing with helping him get sober in 2013 and going from a failing high school math student to graduating with a Bachelor’s degree in Physics and a minor in Mathematics at 33. He has spoken about the role of boxing in these major life transformations in his TEDx talk, keynote speeches, at conferences, and to collegiate football teams.

He’s working on his next book, “Hard Lessons From the Hurt Business: Boxing and the Art of LIfe” set to be published by Penguin Randomhouse in Summer 2025. ![Book deal announcement Ed Latimore](/assets/images/pages/book-deal.jpg){: width="900" height="315"}
