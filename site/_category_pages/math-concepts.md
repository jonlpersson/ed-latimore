      I am not a mathematician.


      I’ve never considered myself good at math. In fact, as I explain in my
      post teaching you [how to get better at
      math](/how-to-get-better-at-math/), I actually failed most of my high
      school math classes. I even failed calculus 3 times before I finally
      understood it on the fourth try.


      Now I have a physics degree. A degree that requires so many math skills
      and the ability to grasp high-level mathematical concepts, that everyone
      who gets it automatically gets a mathematics minor.


      The articles in this section of my website explain many of my unique
      approaches to learning math and physics, along with articles discussing
      many of the real-world applications of mathematics, physics, probability,
      and the problem-solving mindset that comes along with it.


      ## 7 ways to improve numeracy skills


      Numeracy is defined as a person’s general ability to work with and
      understand numbers. It’s not a high-level skill, but it is an important
      one to grasp before you move on to higher-level math.


      This is the general issue people have before they move on to conceptual
      math skills. Conceptual math is the math that requires you to think rather
      than regurgitate. It’s the first step to taking your math lessons and
      applying them to the real world.


      In this article, I give a few ways to help develop your numeracy skills so
      you can solve harder math problems.

      ## 12 reasons why math is important (and how to get better)


      Unfortunately, many American kids tend to write off math because they had
      a bad experience learning it in middle school. That’s unfortunate because
      the most valuable positions in society are occupied by people who are at
      least proficient in math.


      Number sense is money sense and it goes a long way in opening many doors
      for you. Whether in the trades as an electrician or mechanic, a program,
      or an old-fashioned engineer, people who take the time to grasp important
      math concepts make more money and have a higher quality of life.


      But those aren’t the reasons to become proficient at math. This article
      breaks down the 12 reasons why math is important and tells you some ways
      you can get better at math.

      ## 8 unexpected reasons why math is so hard


      I wrote this article because I was contemplating what made math so
      difficult for me and then what made it so much easier for me when I
      approached it again as an adult. Part of it was my renewed interest and
      discipline, but another major factor was that I learned how to learn math.


      This new understanding of how to approach math also made me appreciate why
      a lot of people find even basic math difficult. I wrote this article to
      dig into the main reasons I’ve found that people find math so hard. I also
      give some solutions to help you approach the subject with more confidence.

      ## The easy 4 step problem-solving process (+ examples)


      I taught students how to think during my 3 years as a full-time math and
      physics tutor. Quantitative reasons are fantastic grounds to train people
      to use their minds to think about problems and solve them.


      This article goes through the 4-step problem-solving process that I taught
      to all of them. It worked to not only get them through school but to make
      them better thinkers in life.

      ## Is physics hard? How to learn basic physics


      A lot of people think physics is difficult.


      I suppose they aren’t wrong, per se. The real challenge with physics is
      that you can’t just memorize your way through the course. You have to
      actually learn everything and make sure you grasp the concepts presented.


      It’s also a discipline that requires quantitative reasoning, a strong
      vocabulary, and the ability to visualize things. This article talks about
      all the things you have to do to successfully navigate a physics class.

      ## How to get better at math in 7 simple steps


      This article gives the plan I used to improve my math skills.


      I walk you through how I—[at the age of
      30](/going-back-to-school-at-30/)—relearned all the math from algebra 1,
      up through precalculus and trigonometry to prepare me for calculus and
      physics.


      Here you will not only find inspiration (I show my high school transcripts
      to prove how hopeless I was) but you’ll also get real techniques to help
      you become a more effective mathematician.
