      I greatly improved my quality of life, mental health, and well-being when
      I decided to do inner work. I consider my sobriety date (12/23/13) my
      second birthday. This is the day when I put all the nonsense aside and
      started working on my inner self.


      I don’t like nebulous self-improvement terms like “self-discovery,”
      “self-healing,” and being on my “healing journey.” While many in the
      self-improvement space will find those terms acceptable, I want to speak
      plainly so that everyone can get something from this and get to work on
      the inner work.


      The inner work is work that you do on your personal inadequacies,
      weaknesses, and flaws that are getting in the way of you living the life
      you want to live. It’s not something that can be reading self-help books
      and it’s not a spiritual practice. The inner work is down and dirty
      self-improvement that is neither fun nor easy, but absolutely necessary.


      In my case, I knew that I had pornography addiction, I was an alcoholic, I
      had no confidence in myself, and I couldn’t stick to something long enough
      to reap the rewards. I put a lot of work into myself. The rest of this
      article covers the methods and approaches that I used to do to become the
      best version of myself.


      ## Embracing Adversity: The First Step in The Inner Work


      This journey begins with overcoming adversity. I grew up in poverty,
      raised by a single mom, in public housing. This eventually lead to a
      battle with alcoholism. By acknowledging and confronting these challenges,
      I set the stage for my own personal hero’s journey. We all start
      somewhere, and I start out almost as bad as you can.

      ## The Inner Work Principle: Focusing on Self-Improvement


      tSelf-improvement has been a driving force in my life. I returned to
      school at age 29 to get my degree in physics despite being a failing math
      student. I’ve developed my abilities as a writer and social media
      marketer. I had the self-awareness to know where I was weak and, thanks to
      boxing, developed the growth mindset mindset necessay to do the inner
      work.

      ## Cultivating Emotional Intelligence


      My journey from boxing to public speaking and writing forced me to develop
      emotional intelligence. I learned how to manage my emotions in
      high-pressure situations as well as make new friends and make people feel
      comfortable. You can never over estimate the value of being likable. Being
      likeable has kept me out of prison and given me extra opportunities when I
      made mistakes. As long as people want to help you, you’re never too far
      good. As long as you’re not too far gone, there will also be a chance.
      This is the power of cultivating emotional intelligence.


      Building Self-Awareness:


      A cornerstone of The Inner WorkI have an unwavering commitment to
      self-awareness. I know where my strengths, weaknesses, and motivations
      are. This has allowed me to identify opportunities for personal growth and
      pursue different avenues of success. Doors open for are typically closed
      to otherwise more talented individuals.


      Embracing Vulnerability


      Sharing personal stories and insights requires vulnerability. I firmly
      believe that your life is a waste if you don’t use what you’ve gone
      through to . Through his writing and speaking engagements, he openly
      discusses his experiences, fostering connections with his audience and
      creating opportunities for others to learn from his journey.


      The Inner Work: Cultivating Empathy and Compassion


      In my interactions with others, I try to demonstrate empathy and
      compassion, essential qualities in the inner work journey. By
      understanding people's experiences and feelings on a deeper level, I can
      connect with them more authentically and make a positive impact on their
      lives.


      Here are some practical steps to start your own inner work journey:


      * Reflect on your past experiences and challenges, and acknowledge how
      they have shaped you.

      * Set personal development goals to improve your skills, knowledge, or
      emotional intelligence.

      * Practice mindfulness and meditation to enhance self-awareness and focus.

      * Embrace vulnerability by sharing your experiences and emotions with
      others.

      * Cultivate empathy and compassion by actively listening and seeking to
      understand others' perspectives.


      I’d like to think that my journey of the inner work serves as an inspiring
      example of the power of self-reflection, self-improvement, and emotional
      intelligence in transforming one's life.


      By embracing the principles of the inner work, you too can unlock your
      potential and achieve personal and professional success. Begin your inner
      work journey today and create a positive impact on your own life and the
      lives of others.
