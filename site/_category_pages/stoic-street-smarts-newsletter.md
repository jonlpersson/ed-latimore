      I'm a former heavyweight pro-boxer (13-1-1) and alcoholic (Sobriety date
      12/23/13), current writer, and aspiring chess master. I was raised in the
      projects by a single mom and failed high school, but I eventually earned a
      bachelor's degree in Physics.


      I teach what I've learned from the hood, the ring, and everything in
      between.
