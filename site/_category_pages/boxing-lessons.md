      I was a boxer for 12 years.


      As an amateur, I earned a state Golden Glove Title, a National P.A.L.
      title, and a peak rating of \#4 in the nation. As a professional boxer, I
      was signed to Roc Nation Sports and went 13-1-1.


      Here are some boxing lessons from the boxing gym that you can also use in
      your personal life.


      ## Pain is just a feeling


      Everything in boxing hurts.


      The training, the fighting, even good defense. Discomfort doesn't mean
      anything. In fact, you should worry if you *don't* feel anything. Rarely,
      does pain come before the knockout punch. You just suddenly find yourself
      on the canvas wondering what happened.


      Hurting is a sign that you're still in the game

      ## The punch you don't see is the one that knocks you out


      As long as you can keep your mind alert enough to see what's coming, there
      is little chance it will overwhelm you. But the moment something sneaks
      past you, it's going to do more damage because you aren't ready.


      When something slips past your defense, it doesn’t matter your level of
      strength & conditioning or your cardio level. The fight will be over.


      Life is like this as well. It’s always the thing you don’t expect and
      don’t see coming that will put you down the hardest.


      ## Don't blink


      Normies flinch when a threat comes their way.


      A fighter will be destroyed by feints if he reacts to everything. There is
      no advantage to flinching. Either it's a distraction to set you up for
      something worse OR it's the real thing and by not biting, you're ready.


      There is nothing to fear in the fight but losing control of your mind. As
      long as you have that, then you have a great chance of surviving and even
      winning.

      ## Make 'em miss close


      Make your opponent miss by as little as possible.


      If they miss you by too much, you won't be in a position to capitalize.


      You can't flinch. You can't freak out. You must be patient, brave, and
      relaxed when you're under fire. It's the only way to capitalize.

      ## Fear is useful


      When you're afraid, it means you take the threat seriously.


      It's pointless to try and stop being nervous. Instead, recognize it as a
      call to harness all of your faculties on the task at hand. Fear should
      invigorate you. Like pain, worry when you don't feel it.


      Fear lets you know that you’re alive. It lets you know that there is
      something worth fighting for that you must prepare for.


      ## Talent is real


      But it's useless without heart & discipline


      You need discipline to train and develop your talent. You need heart to
      fight If you lack discipline, you won't survive the training If you lack
      talent, you won't survive the fight If you lack heart, you're useless.

      ## Beauty is boredom


      You won't become good at something until you're practicing it to
      boredom–and then keep practicing. No one becomes talented if they only
      practice when motivated or excited–because most practice is boring.


      This is a feature to weed people out. Not a bug.

      ## Control your emotions


      This doesn't mean being emotionless. It means that you do things with your
      emotions as the passenger; not the driver.


      You can't give in to your feelings, because they will betray the future
      you mentally planned for and physically trained to attain.


      ## No one likes getting hit


      But you won't survive if you don't learn how to roll with the punches and
      tolerate pain.


      You need to land punches to win, but it's more important to be able to
      take a punch than to give one.


      ## There are only two ways to get anything worthwhile


      The hard way and the *really* hard way. Once you accept that, then you can
      get to work putting in the painful, miserable work.


      It's always gonna suck because it's not supposed to be fun. It's supposed
      to develop you.
