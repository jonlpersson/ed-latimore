      Porn addiction is unique among all types of addictions because it’s
      private. Not only is it a solo activity, but there also aren’t the obvious
      signs that your life is falling apart the way there is with other
      addictions.


      It’s easy to recognize when a loved one can’t stop drinking because
      they’re often drunk and/or end up with a DUI or losing their job.


      Drug users are also different from porn addicts. Problems with drug abuse
      are relatively easy to spot because of how mind-alteringly powerful many
      drugs are—not to mention how illegal they are.


      Pornography addiction, by contrast, is silent but can be just as
      debilitating.


      It’s perfectly reasonable for a person to win in all areas of life but
      have a debilitating internet pornography addiction. Even if they’re caught
      in the act of porn use, it’s difficult to know if someone is addicted to
      porn.


      This means that family members can’t stage an intervention and, unlike
      most other substance abuse issues, there are very few porn addict
      anonymous meetings, support groups, or treatment programs.


      Very often, it will be up to the porn users to recognize that they have a
      problem and to get their pornography use under control. Because I’ve
      managed to overcome one of the most addictive behaviors a man can succumb
      to, I’ve written various articles to help recover from porn addiction.


      ## 6 signs that you’re definitely addicted to porn


      It’s impossible to know that you have a problem if you don’t even know
      what having a problem looks like. This article lists the signs of porn
      addiction that you may have overlooked.


      In fact, many guys don’t realize that sexual dysfunction and constant
      cravings for porn place of real women is a big sign they’re addicted to
      internet porn.


      I also cover the mental health aspect, the role of dopamine(particularly
      how porn addiction is often a sign of other mental health disorders), and
      various self-esteem issues that arise from porn addiction.

      ## 7 easy ways to finally quit porn


      This is a no-nonsense plan I used to quit porn. I’m not a medical
      professional, but I can confidently say that this free article is as good
      as any porn addiction treatment, inpatient or outpatient method.


      I can confidently say that in terms of getting results, this article
      outlines a highly effective treatment plan that will work for anyone who
      wants to stop viewing porn.


      I give practical advice that changes your physical behavior. Unlike many
      programs, I won't tell you to stop masturbating, as men have been
      masturbating way before internet porn. My goal is to get you to stop
      watching porn. As long as they aren’t illegal, I don’t care what your
      other sexual behaviors are.

      ## Why is porn so hard to quit?


      Most consider porn addiction a behavioral addiction. For comparison's
      sake, drug and alcohol abuse are far more likely to be chemical
      addictions. If someone comes off of porn, they’ll just be annoyed and
      anxious. If you take someone off opioids, they will physically suffer
      through withdrawal.


      Still, porn is incredibly difficult to quit. Why is that? This article
      explains why so that you have proper respect for your problem.

      consequences of porn and why you need to quit. This one reminds you of all
      the benefits you’ll get when you finally get your porn habit under
      control.


      After you go for a period of time without porn, your attraction to women
      in real life will skyrocket, your sex life will improve, and you’ll become
      a more confident and effective man. If you think quitting porn isn’t worth
      it, you want to read this article.
