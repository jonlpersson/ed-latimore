When I was an alcoholic, one of the ways I could trick people was with my success in boxing.

As long as I kept winning fights, people either looked the other way, made excuses for me, or wisely distanced themselves. While I’m grateful for everyone who didn’t give up on me, that doesn’t change what I was:

A highly functioning alcoholic whose alcohol abuse nearly cost him everything.

In this article, I mention both the obvious and subtle signs someone will show if they are secretly an alcoholic, high-functioning or otherwise. If you found this article inquiring about your own condition, you may discover things are worse than you thought.

Whether it’s for yourself or a loved one, I’ve included some resources at the end to help you. You can also download a free chapter of my book “Sober Letters To My Drunken Self,” which I wrote to help people who need help but weren’t interested in going to alcohol rehab.

## High-functioning alcoholic versus typical alcoholic

If you ask the average person to describe the life of someone with a drinking problem, they usually imagine someone who can’t hold a job, has a DUI or few, and can’t step foot in a bar without losing their mind and getting blackout drunk.

While most of those things are true for high-functioning alcoholics, there is a notable exception: they almost always have a job or a significant professional position.

If you looked at how things go in their daily life, you’d never know they have a drinking problem. But if you peak just beneath the surface, you’ll not only see a heavy drinker that easily fits the bill of an alcoholic, but their drinking habits are often way worse and far more dangerous than anyone could ever imagine.

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [categorizes drinking behaviors into five subtypes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2094392/). High-functioning alcoholics, as the name suggests, fall into the “functional” subtype. 1 in 5 people with alcohol use disorders (AUD) is this drinker.

Functional types tend to have a mid-to-high level income, a steady job, are well-educated, and have families and steady relationships. These are not the traits you think about when you typically imagine an alcoholic.

When your life isn’t falling apart, no one thinks of your drinking as a problem. But I know from experience that it is very much a problem.

Alcoholism is a complex health issue that doesn’t look the same in everyone. In my book “Sober Letters to My Drunken Self,” I said that *“there are people who have a drinking problem and people who have problems when they drink.”*

The idea is that while every alcoholic is the same, every alcoholic is also different.

Some are in and out of jail, others are high-powered businessmen or professional athletes, and then there are those struggling with alcohol dependence in secret. Not all alcoholics look like the stereotype of an addict.

Just because you don’t walk like a duck doesn’t mean you don’t quack when you open your mouth. This is why it’s important to understand the signs of a high-functioning alcoholic. High-functioning alcoholism is like any other problem. You have to recognize it before you can do something about it.

If you or someone you know is exhibiting any of these signs. symptoms, or red flags, act fast. It might save your life or the life of someone that you love.
