When I was an alcoholic, one of the ways I could trick people was with my success in boxing.

As long as I kept winning fights, people either looked the other way, made excuses for me, or wisely distanced themselves. While I’m grateful for everyone who didn’t give up on me, that doesn’t change what I was:

A highly functioning alcoholic whose alcohol abuse nearly cost him everything.

In this article, I mention both the obvious and subtle signs someone will show if they are secretly an alcoholic, high-functioning or otherwise. If you found this article inquiring about your own condition, you may discover things are worse than you thought.

Whether it’s for yourself or a loved one, I’ve included some resources at the end to help you. You can also download a free chapter of my book “Sober Letters To My Drunken Self,” which I wrote to help people who need help but weren’t interested in going to alcohol rehab.

## High-functioning alcoholic versus typical alcoholic

If you ask the average person to describe the life of someone with a drinking problem, they usually imagine someone who can’t hold a job, has a DUI or few, and can’t step foot in a bar without losing their mind and getting blackout drunk.

While most of those things are true for high-functioning alcoholics, there is a notable exception: they almost always have a job or a significant professional position.

If you looked at how things go in their daily life, you’d never know they have a drinking problem. But if you peak just beneath the surface, you’ll not only see a heavy drinker that easily fits the bill of an alcoholic, but their drinking habits are often way worse and far more dangerous than anyone could ever imagine.

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism categorizes drinking behaviors into five subtypes. High-functioning alcoholics, as the name suggests, fall into the “functional” subtype. 1 in 5 people with alcohol use disorders (AUD) is this drinker.
