When I was an alcoholic, one of the ways I could trick people was with my success in boxing.

As long as I kept winning fights, people either looked the other way, made excuses for me, or wisely distanced themselves. While I’m grateful for everyone who didn’t give up on me, that doesn’t change what I was:

A highly functioning alcoholic whose alcohol abuse nearly cost him everything.

In this article, I mention both the obvious and subtle signs someone will show if they are secretly an alcoholic, high-functioning or otherwise. If you found this article inquiring about your own condition, you may discover things are worse than you thought.

Whether it’s for yourself or a loved one, I’ve included some resources at the end to help you. You can also download a free chapter of my book “Sober Letters To My Drunken Self,” which I wrote to help people who need help but weren’t interested in going to alcohol rehab.
