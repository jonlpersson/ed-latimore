Maintaining a level head is undoubtedly one of the most crucial skills you can develop. It can make a huge difference, sometimes even saving your life, in situations where you might not even be aware of the danger. After all, you never know who you're dealing with:

* Someone who might have a gun
* They don't care about going to jail
* They're "mobbed up"
* They're protected from the law, by the law

It's not difficult to imagine encountering someone in any of these scenarios, particularly given the easy availability of firearms in the United States (where I reside) and the prevalence of individuals with questionable mental states or ties to organized crime.

Organized crime might be illegal, but its influence is so vast that many of its members enjoy de facto immunity. Even in cases dealing with low-level street gangs, the threat of intimidation can be surprisingly potent, causing witnesses to forget crucial details of an incident.

That's why I always suggest being polite to everyone you encounter. You never know who doesn't care about ending up behind bars, and even if the person is blatantly in the wrong and is trying to provoke you, it's vital to remain calm and composed. Not everyone values the same things you do, such as life, liberty, and freedom.

No matter the circumstance, it's always a good idea to treat people with respect and kindness. Even if they’re a true asshole, the best-case scenario is that you gain instant gratification if you respond with similar hostility and malice. The worst-case scenario, believe it or not, is NOT that they’ll retaliate.

Good manners never make a situation worse.
