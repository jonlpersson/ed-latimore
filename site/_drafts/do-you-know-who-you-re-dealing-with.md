Maintaining a level head is undoubtedly one of the most crucial skills you can develop. It can make a huge difference, sometimes even saving your life, in situations where you might not even be aware of the danger. After all, you never know who you're dealing with:

* Someone who might have a gun
* They don't care about going to jail
* They're "mobbed up"
* They're protected from the law, by the law

It's not difficult to imagine encountering someone in any of these scenarios, particularly given the easy availability of firearms in the United States (where I reside) and the prevalence of individuals with questionable mental states or ties to organized crime.
