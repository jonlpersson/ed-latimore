Before I dive into my review of the Bosley Revitalizer 272, I will quickly take you through my hair loss journey. Feel free to skip this part, but I included it here for two reasons:

1. I want to be completely transparent about what I’ve tried and not tried.
2. I want you to understand the cost and limits of everything out there.
3. I don’t want you to think that I got my results ONLY using low-level laser therapy (lllt)

## My hair loss to hair regrowth journey

I think my hair loss started around age 23. At the very least, that’s when people close to me could notice my thinning hair. By 27, I was between level 3 and 4 on the Norwood-Hamilton androgenetic alopecia baldness scale.

I tried minoxidil. Maybe it worked. Maybe it didn’t. I’ll never be completely sure because minoxidil is great at stopping hair loss, but it’s not something that usually regrows hair. I tried oral finasteride for a month, but I stopped after I started to get a painful throbbing in my testicles.

At the age of 33, I got my first FUE hair transplant. 10 months later, I got my second FUE hair transplant. Not only does my hair look great as a result, but now I’ve got fuller hair to preserve. This makes me much more motivated to use Minoxidil daily (as of this writing, I’m on over a year streak of daily application), but it allows me to reap the benefits of other hair loss treatments fully.

This brings me nicely to my discovery of laser light technology and my experimentation with Bosley’s Revitalizer 272 laser cap.

## Two disclaimers (You can also skip this if you want)

Before we dig into this section, I have to give you two major disclaimers:

1. While Bosley hasn’t paid me for this review, they did supply me with a free laser cap to try. This doesn’t misalign my incentives or affect my review because they aren’t paying me any affiliate commission for any sold. Also, I already paid them about $20k for my two hair transplants.
2. I haven’t tried other lllt technologies or laser hair growth therapy caps. I know other companies make competing devices (Hairmax, Irestore, Illumiflow, etc.), but I haven’t used them. This is one customer review of one specific brand. Don’t take this as an indictment against or an endorsement of laser hair restoration technology. It’s only an assessment of Bosley’s Revitalizer 272.

With that out of the way, let’s dig into the functions, features, and promises of the Bosley Revitalizer 272

## What you need to know about low-level laser therapy (lllt)

I wrote an in-depth article how LLLT works. You can read the whole thing by clicking below:

How Low-Level Laser Therapy works

The TL:DR summary is that LLLT uses low-power laser at a specific wavelength to stimulate hair growth. If the hair follicles aren’t completely miniaturized. However, even hair follicles that are fairly advanced in their miniaturization are able to be reversed as a result of LLLT.

When I got my hair transplants back in in 2018 and 2019, I actually had no idea that this technology existed. Apparently it was only in its infancy and was only available at certain locations.

With as well as it’s been reported to work, it appears to be a serious cost effective alternative to expensive hair restoration procedures or medications that alter your hormonal profile. It’s a non-invasive way to grow your hair back that has a high success rate.

It’s also worth noting that the technology works on both men and women with no adverse side effects. This is significant because any topical or chemical hair loss solutions have not only been off limits women, but there have also been significant side effects for men as well.

## The features of the Bosley Revitalizer 272

* **FDA cleared device.** This is important. Not every laser cap on the market has been given the clinical seal of approval. This doesn’t stop them from selling the devices, but it does mean that it isn’t been held to an independent clinical and technological standard.
* **Uses lasers diodes. Not LEDs (light emitting diodes).** When this technology first become available, many models use LED lights rather than lasers. The difference between the two is the LED light is not coheret, convergent, or in unison (Read the section of my article on LLLT about these qualities here—&gt;The 3 qualities that make a laser different from conventional light sources). LEDs just provide a type of red light therapy, which is not the same as LLLT. The Bosley Revitalizer 272 uses medical grade laser emitting diodes (not light emitting diodes) for treatment.
* **272 medical grade laser emitting diodes.** This is what the 272 in “Bosley Revitalizer 272” stands for. This enables the cap to give your scalp full coverage in the areas where hair loss occurs (hairline, temples, and vertex).

## Who can use the Bosley Revitalizer 272?

The laser treatment device is ideal for men and women suffering from:

* Androgenic alopecia
* Hormonal hair loss
* Postpartum hair loss
* Hair loss from illness
* Hair loss from chemotherapy
* Hair loss from aging
* People with all hair types
* Anyone who wants thicker hair, fuller hair, or healthy hair

The Bosley Revitalizer 272 can be used by almost anyone suffering from hair loss, caused hormonally or otherwise. While there is always the possibility of failure in treatments like this, the success rate is high, and like all hair loss treatments, the earlier you start, the better.

Advanced hair loss (Norwood-Hamilton scale of 5 or greater/Ludwig-Savin scale of 4 or greater) is not automatically a failure. Still, the results may be less impressive and take longer to achieve.

## What’s included with the laser cap and how does it work

* Laser cap with the laser diodes
* Sports cap with Bosely logo to cover the sports cap
* Rechargeable battery pack
* Controller pod to activate

It’s a basic setup that’s easy to assemble and maintain. The initial charge will take about six hours.

You can choose to use it for 8 minutes daily or 30 minutes every other day. While I doubt anything dangerous would happen if you used it more frequently than this, it wouldn’t speed up the rate of hair restoration, as the rate of hair growth is a fixed upper limit.

This Bosley Revitalizer is extremely easy to use. You just put the cap on, turn the switch, and let it do its thing.

If you decide to pick it up, order from Amazon at this link—&gt;order here. I get a small, nearly insignificant commission if you purchase from there. This commission is not from Bosley, but I still figured I’d let you know in case you found my review helpful.

You clear the inside of the cap as needed with simple alcohol. I imagine that it will get dirty, but using it right after you shower before putting any conditioners or creams in your hair that for style or aid your hair restoration should keep it clean.

The warranty policy is quite simple. Purchases automatically come with a limited 1-year warranty which can be extended to 2 years. The device needs to be registered at https://www.bosley.com/RevitalizerRegistration.

This warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship. If Bosely determines that the device suffers from a defect under the warranty period, the parts will be repaired or replaced at no cost to the original purchaser. The warranty only applies to the original purchaser and cannot be transferred.
