As a professional boxer, I'm always looking for any advantage that I can get—especially since, as of the time of this writing, I'm less than 18 months away from my 40th birthday.

In the fight against Father Time, no one is undefeated. And because of the rules of World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) that govern the sport of boxing, there are many substances that would give me an edge and are not criminally illegal, but they are forbidden for competitive athletes.

As a result, I've devoted a significant amount of time and energy to researching ways to beat the competition without breaking the rules. Most athletes are focused on increasing their testosterone, muscle mass, breathing, or decreasing their recovery time.

However, one of the most overlooked ways to gain an advantage is to increase quickly you think, process, learn, and react. Enter acetylcholine. Even if you aren't a competitive athlete, you should continue reading to not only learn why this neurotransmitter is important for staying sharp and solving problems, but also how to increasing the synthesis of it in your brain so you can get the most out of your mind and life.

Increasing and optimizing my acetylcholine levels has made a big difference in my chess game, my training, and even in my day to day living. The rest of this article covers some things you can add to your diet or supplement stack to optimize this powerful neurotransmitter and take your mental processing power to the next level.&nbsp;

## What is Acetylcholine and why it matters?

Acetylcholine is most celebrated for its impact on memory and learning. Memories and learning happen through a number of processes, the acetylcholine is most prominent in a process known as "synaptic plasticity."

Synaptic plasticity refer's to the ability of the brain's neural network to modify the strength of their connections. This process is not only important when it comes to forming new memories, connections, an learning, but also in recovery after damage to the brain ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6940892/)).&nbsp;

Because of the neurotransmitter's role in synaptic plasticity, the brain requires acetylcholine to form memories. Even more interesting, acetylcholine levels in the brain rise during REM sleep. People typically think of acetylcholine as something to help them stay focused and boost awareness, but perhaps it's more accurate to think of it as something to increase the strength of your neural connections.

This interpretation of acetylcholine makes sense consider that many ingredients in supplements designed to increase acetylcholine levels and boost your ability to learn also have shown a proclivity for inducing the theta brain wave state. This is the most common state in the "flow" state of mind and the one that researchers have most associated with dreaming.&nbsp;

This dreaming bit may seem like a tangent, but it's essential to the bigger picture of the power of acetylcholine. Researchers at the University of Rome have discovered that while dreaming, the brain looks identical to a brain that is retrieving memories ([source](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-science-behind-dreaming/)).

We know that dreams happen during the REM stage of sleep. The same stage that acetylcholine is elevated. I posit that this means another benefit of acetylcholine is that it boosts your ability to synthesize ideas and create new lines of thinking. Or, at the very least, lack of it will impair your natural creativity.
