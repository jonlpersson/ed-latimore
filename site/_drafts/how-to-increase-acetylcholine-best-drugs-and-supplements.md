As a professional boxer, I'm always looking for any advantage that I can get—especially since, as of the time of this writing, I'm less than 18 months away from my 40th birthday.

In the fight against Father Time, no one is undefeated. And because of the rules of World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) that govern the sport of boxing, there are many substances that would give me an edge and are not criminally illegal, but they are forbidden for competitive athletes.

As a result, I've devoted a significant amount of time and energy to researching ways to beat the competition without breaking the rules. Most athletes are focused on increasing their testosterone, muscle mass, breathing, or decreasing their recovery time.

However, one of the most overlooked ways to gain an advantage is to increase quickly you think, process, learn, and react. Enter acetylcholine. Even if you aren't a competitive athlete, you should continue reading to not only learn why this neurotransmitter is important for staying sharp and solving problems, but also how to increasing the synthesis of it in your brain so you can get the most out of your mind and life.

Increasing and optimizing my acetylcholine levels has made a big difference in my chess game, my training, and even in my day to day living. The rest of this article covers some things you can add to your diet or supplement stack to optimize this powerful neurotransmitter and take your mental processing power to the next level.&nbsp;

## What is Acetylcholine and why it matters?

Acetylcholine is most celebrated for its impact on memory and learning. Memories and learning happen through a number of processes, the acetylcholine is most prominent in a process known as "synaptic plasticity."

Synaptic plasticity refer's to the ability of the brain's neural network to modify the strength of their connections. This process is not only important when it comes to forming new memories, connections, an learning, but also in recovery after damage to the brain ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6940892/)).&nbsp;

Because of the neurotransmitter's role in synaptic plasticity, the brain requires acetylcholine to form memories.&nbsp;
