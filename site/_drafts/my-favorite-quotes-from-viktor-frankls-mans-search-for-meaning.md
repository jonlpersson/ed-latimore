I recently finished Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search For Meaning.

The book is divided into 2 parts: The first part of the book is about Frankl's experiences in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II. He reflects on and analyzes not only his struggle, but the struggle of both the inmates and the guards in the camp. The second half is about his logotherapy practice, some of the case and treatments, and how he applied his lessons from the surviving the holocaust.

According to the Library of Congress,&nbsp;*Man's Search for Meaning*&nbsp;belongs to a list of "the ten most influential books in the United States." At the time of the Frankl's death in 1997, the book had sold over 10 million copies and had been translated into 24 languages.

"Man's Search For Meaning" has It carries many lessons about stoicism, gratitude, and adaptibility. Here are 17 of the most impactful quotes from the book.

## Getting used to the horror of concentration camp brutality

"Disgust, horror and pity are emotions that our spectator could not really feel any more. The sufferers, the dying and the dead, became such commonplace sights to him after a few weeks of camp life that they could not move him any more."

---

"Apathy, the blunting of the emotions and the feeling that one could not care any more, were the symptoms arising during the second stage of the prisoner’s psychological reactions, and which eventually made him insensitive to daily and hourly beatings. By means of this insensibility the prisoner soon surrounded himself with a very necessary protective shell."

---

"Apathy, the main symptom of the second phase, was a necessary mechanism of self-defense. Reality dimmed, and all efforts and all emotions were centered on one task: preserving one’s own life and that of the other fellow."

## Coping with unreasonable cruelty

"At such a moment it is not the physical pain which hurts the most (and this applies to adults as much as to punished children); it is the mental agony caused by the injustice, the unreasonableness of it all."

**Note:** Frankl telling the story of receiving a beating for being a little out of symmetry in a line for bread rations

---

"Strangely enough, a blow which does not even find its mark can, under certain circumstances, hurt more than one that finds its mark."

**Note:** Frankl is telling a story of how a guard noticed he took a short break to catch his breath and instead of recieving a beating, he merely toss a stone. "That, to me, seemed the way to attract the attention of a beast, to call a domestic animal back to its job, a creature with which you have so little in common that you do not even punish it."

---

"The meager pleasures of camp life provided a kind of negative happiness—“freedom from suffering” as Schopenhauer put it—and even that in a relative way only."

## Losing the illusion of hope in the camps

"All that mattered was that one’s own name and that of one’s friend were crossed off the list of victims, though everyone knew that for each man saved another victim had to be found."

---

"There was neither time nor desire to consider moral or ethical issues. Every man was controlled by one thought only: to keep himself alive for the family waiting for him at home, and to save his friends. With no hesitation, therefore, he would arrange for another prisoner, another “number,” to take his place in the transport."

## The power of love

"The truth—that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved."

---

"n a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way —an honorable way—in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment. For the first time in my life I was able to understand the meaning of the words, “The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.”"

---

"Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance."

## Frankl on judgement

"No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same."

---

"These former prisoners often say, “We dislike talking about our experiences. No explanations are needed for those who have been inside, and the others will understand neither how we felt then nor how we feel now.”"

---

“There are things which must cause you to lose your reason or you have none to lose.”

---

"An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior."

## Survival mentality in the concentration camps

"But the desperately ill received no medicine. It would not have helped, and besides, it would have deprived those for whom there was still some hope."

---

"It is very difficult for an outsider to grasp how very little value was placed on human life in camp."

---

"As I have mentioned before, we had no documents; everyone was lucky to own his body, which, after all, was still breathing."

---

"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way."

---

"All that mattered was that one’s own name and that of one’s friend were crossed off the list of victims, though everyone knew that for each man saved another victim had to be found."

---

"There was neither time nor desire to consider moral or ethical issues. Every man was controlled by one thought only: to keep himself alive for the family waiting for him at home, and to save his friends. With no hesitation, therefore, he would arrange for another prisoner, another “number,” to take his place in the transport."
