Low-level laser (light) therapy (LLLT) is&nbsp;**a medical technology that has been used to treat a variety of by stimulating healing, relief of pain and inflammation, and restoration of function**. LLLT, also called photobiomodulation or cold laser, is a type of&nbsp;[phototherapy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/phototherapy){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}&nbsp;that utilizes wavelengths of light in the visible to the nearly infrared range of 670–950 nanometers (nm).

They are referred to as "low-level" or "low power" because they operate with a low wattage (W) level. Typically, these lasers are usually between 5 and 500 mW

This answers the question of \*what\* a low-level laser is, but it doesn't tell us anything about \*how\* a low-level laser works. To answer this question specifically, we have to start with some cool science, define some basic terms, and take a trip back a few decades.

## What is a laser?

The word “laser” is an acronym for “Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation”. A laser is any device that is capable of emitting light via a process known as “optical stimulation” based on the stimulated emission of radiation.

A laser generates a beam of intense light. We aren’t concerned about the mechanisms of laser beam generation. Those are unnecessary to understand LLLT and answer questions around it’s safety and efficacy. However, we must understand the basic characteristics of all laser beams compared to conventional light.&nbsp;

The major difference between laser light and light generated by white light sources (your normal experience with light, like from a light bulb) is that laser light is monochromatic, directional and coherent. ([Source for images](https://ehs.princeton.edu/book/export/html/348))

**Monochromatic**\: All hat all of the light produced by the laser is of a single wavelength. White light is a combination of all visible wavelengths (400 - 700 nm). The rainbow produced by a prism is white light broken into all the colors it makes up. In fact, when you see a rainbow, it’s a result of the rain droplets in the air in the sky acting as a prism.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Directional:** Normally, light propogates from its source in a divergent wave pattern. This causes light to lose its intensity over a relatively short distance. In exchange for that trade off, the photos of the light illuminate a wide area make them useful to see.&nbsp;

In contrast, laser output has very little divergence and can maintain high beam intensities over long ranges.&nbsp; As a result, relatively low power lasers are able to project more energy at a single wavelength within a narrow beam than can be obtained from more powerful conventional light sources.

**C****oherent:** Coherent light is light whose photons oscillate at the same frequency and whose wavelengths are in phase. Incoherent light is the opposite of this. The photons of incoherent light oscillate at different frequencies, and their wave lengths are not in phase with each other.

To put all of this in perspective, consider that the watt (W) s the fundamental unit of optical power, is defined as a rate of energy of one joule (J) per second. Your average householdincandescent light bulbs use about **60 watts** of electricity, and LED light bulbs use about 10 watts.&nbsp;

Unless you touch their surface, you’ve never been burned or cut with the light from a lightbulb. However, because of a laser’s characteristics, [that same wattage can carve acrylic or aluminnum.](https://www.troteclaser.com/en/learn-support/faqs/optimal-laser-power)

## What is Low Level Light Therapy?

After the discovery of lasers in the 1960s it was accidentally discovered that laser therapy at low energy levels had the potential to improve wound healing and reduce pain, inflammation and swelling. This feature of lasers was discovered quite by accident by Endre Mester at Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary in 1967.&nbsp;

Mester conducted an experiment to test if laser radiation caused cancer in mice. He shaved the hair off their backs, divided them into two groups and irradiated one group with a low powered ruby laser.&nbsp;

The treatment group did not get cancer and to his surprise, the hair grew back more quickly than the untreated group. He called this “Laser Biostimulation”. Mester soon applied his findings to human patients, using lasers to treat patients with nonhealing skin ulcers

We’ve already established that commercial laser applications are typically in the range of 25-80 W. Low level laser therapy is a laser application that ranges between 1mW – 500mW. Since 1967 over 100 phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials have been published and supported by over 1,000 laboratory studies how it works and many of it’s effects.

## How does low level light therapy work?

The precise biochemical mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of LLLT is not completely understood. We know for sure that LLLT acts by inducing a photochemical reaction in the cell, a process referred to as biostimulation or photobiomodulation.

It’s believed that this chemical reaction acts on the mitochondria[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3288797/#R27) to increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production,[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3288797/#R43) modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the induction of transcription factors.

It’s known that ATP production increases when an injury is sustained to faciliate healing, as it plays a significant role in would repair ([source](https://www.energy-delivery-solutions.com/about-atp)). Reactive oxygen species cause damage to the basic building blocks of the cell, including lipids, proteins, DNA, and RNA ([source](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.628157/full)). The induction of transcription factors leads to regulation of gene expression that may of previously been modulated or repressed.

These three factors combined lead to a dramatic increase of cellular healing and repair.

## How does low level light therapy work to slow or reverse hair loss?

To fully appreciate how low level light therapy works for hair loss, we have to briefly revisit the four stages of hair growth.

* Anagen phase: This is the growing phase of hair. During the anagen phase, your [hair follicles](https://www.healthline.com/health/hair-follicle) push out hairs that will continue to grow until they’re cut or until they reach the end of their lifespan and fall out. It’s key to remember that the hairs start beneat the skin and have been growing long before they are visible.&nbsp;
* Catagen phase: This is the phase where the anagen phase ends. Hair follicles shink and hair growth slows. Also, during this phase, hair separates from the bottom of the follicle but has not separated or started “shedding”.
* Telogen phase: Hairs don’t grow during the telogen phase, but they don’t usually fall out either. The telogen phase is also when new hairs start to form in follicles that have just released hairs during the catagen phase.&nbsp;
* Exogen phase: This is the phase that hair typically sheds, as the new growth pushes out the hairs that were separated during. The exogen phase is often considered an extension of the telogen stage. During the exogen phase, losing 50 to 100 hairs per day is normal.

Male androgentic alopecia(MAA), male pattern baldness, or going bald happens when the anagen phase decreases while the telogen phase remains the same length or gets longer. Ultimately, anagen duration becomes so short that the growing hair fails to achieve sufficient length to reach the surface of the skin, leaving an empty follicular pore.

All of this is thought to be caused by DHT causes the hair follicles to shrink, simultaneously extending the amount of time in and hair available for the telegen and exogen phase and reducing the growth the occur in the anagen phase.&nbsp;

Analogously, think of this like trying to fill a bucket with a tiny hole in the side that is growing. MAA causes simultaneously causes the rate of the rate coming into the bucket to slow while increasing the size of the hole in the side of the bucket. Eventually, not only will the water rate slow to barely a trickle, the hole in the side of the bucket will be so big that any water still running in won’t be able to go above a certain level.

Then enters low level laser therapy. Think of low level laser therapy as both a construction worker patching up the hole in the wall and the plumber unclogging hose that is supplying water to the bucket.&nbsp;

Low level light therapy is assumed to shorten the telogen phase so that hair follicles enter the anagen phase more quickly. It’s also assumed to prolong duration of anagen phase, increase rates of proliferation in active anagen hair follicles and to prevent premature passage into the catagen phase \[[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/#R19),[30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/#R30)\].

From a mechanistic standpoint, this effectively reverses male pattern balding. Of course, if the hair follicle is already minaturized to the point of no return, then LLLT won’t be effective. The plumber can only unclog the drain to be effective if the water hasn’t been shut off.&nbsp;

Weiss and coworkers, by using RT-PCR and microarray analysis, demonstrated that depending on the treatment parameters. LLLT has also been shown to effect the biochemical causes of hair loss.&nbsp;

Low level light therapy has also been shown to:

* Modulate 5-α reductase expression, which converts testosterone into DHT.
* Alters vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGf) gene expression to promote angiogensis (new blood vein formation) which have significant roles in hair follicle growth hair growth on human dermal papillae cells \[[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/#R44)–[47](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/#R47)\].&nbsp;
* LLLT has been demonstrated to modulate inflammatory processes and immunological responses, which may also have an effect in hair regrowth \[[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/#R32),[48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/#R48)\].
* Considering that inflammatory has been shown to play a role in the androgenic alopecia, modulatory effects of LLLT on inflammation might have a significant role in causing hair regrowth \[[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/#R19)\].

Does low level level light therapy cause shedding?

LLLT does not cause shedding. If we consider everything we’ve discussed about how the hair cycle works and LLLT’s effect on it, we can easy see why shedding doesn’t happen.

LLLT works by shortening the telogen phase and prolonging the anagen phase. This automatically means that fewer hairs are even capable of shedding because they spend less time in the telogen phase, the phase where shedding occurs.

People believe that LLLT causes shedding because when you start the treatment, dead hairs (hairs no longer attached to the blood source of the follicle) are cast away quickly, but only because the anagen phase is extended and more hair is new hair as growing.

You may initially notice more hair falling out when you first begin low-level laser hair therapy. However, these hairs were in the telogen resting phase and were going to fall out \*anyway\*.

Not only does low-level light therapy not cause shedding, causes the exact opposite outcome. You experience less shedding because the shedding phase (telogen) is shortened and the growth phase (anagen) is lengthened.

## What type of results to expect

Low-level light therapy produces excellent results for thinning hair resulting from weakened, thinner hair follicles. As with all hair loss treatments, the earlier you start to apply the treatment, the better the result you can expect.&nbsp;

LLLT does not work in advanced cases of baldness. It cannot cause hair growth on areas of the scalp where there’s no hair at all, as there are no hair follicles to stimulate. For all intents and purposes, this is what happens if your hair loss is too great. LLLT only works on active hair follicles and has no effect on hair follicles that are already shrunken and dead.

Research has shown that LLLT helped to slow down or even stop hair loss in 85% of patients undergoing treatment. A&nbsp;[2013 study of 41 males ages 18 to 48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24078483){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} found that laser hair treatment provided a 39 percent increase in hair growth over a period of 16 weeks.

[A metanalysis of LLLT](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lsm.22170){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}showed that both men and women experienced substantial growth in temporal hair loss (55% in women, 74% in men) and vertex (65% in women, 120% in men).

The same metanalysis references a study demonstrating significant improvements in overall hair regrowth, slowing of hair loss, thicker feeling hair, better scalp health, and hair shine was also demonstrated in terms of patients' subjective assessment at 26 weeks over baseline.

## Is Low-Level Light Therapy safe?

In over 50 years of use, LLLT has a low incidence of adverse effects. In the specific use of LLLT for hair growth, the only issue was the onset of telogen effluvium but the onset of it only lasted for 1-2 months.

Telogen effluvium is a form of temporary hair loss that usually happens after stress, a shock, or a traumatic event. It usually occurs on the top of the scalp. Telogen effluvium is different from the hair loss disorder called alopecia areata.
