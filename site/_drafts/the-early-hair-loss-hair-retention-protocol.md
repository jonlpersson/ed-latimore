I don’t remember when I started losing my hair. I don’t think most who suffer from male pattern baldness ever do. However, most of us remember when someone else points out that we’re losing hair.

When I was 27, a guy I boxed with pointed out that I was going bald. At age 28, one of my drill sergeants at basic training (I enlisted relatively late) made a joke about it.

I tried minoxidil (Rogaine foam) with hardly any results. I also tried finasteride (Propecia) pills, but I stopped because I got a strange pain in my groin that lined up with a lot of the crazy symptoms I’d read about in regards to Propecia.

Eventually, I got 2 FUE hair transplants and I got back a full head of hair. Except there was only one problem: It’s possible to still lose hair that hadn’t fallen out. This meant that I would need to do something to keep my remaining hair from falling out. From that problem, my hair retention protocol was born.

## Warnings about the hair retention protocol

Before I tell you what to do, I have to give you a few caveats about this protocol.&nbsp;

### You have to be patient

It’s possible that when I first tried Minoxidil, I didn’t give it enough time to work. With that said, it’s widely known that Minoxidil works best at slowing down hair loss and hair shedding. Most people don’t experience regrowth. I could have been one of the guys that experience hair regrowth, but I just didn’t stick with it long enough to find out.

The hair retentional protocol has a fairly high success rate but is not instantaneous. It will take 6-12 months for any noticeable changes to happen. You’ll stop losing hair almost immediately, so things shouldn’t get much worse (except for the temporary shedding), but it takes a small amount of time for things to get better.

### You have to be early

This protocol works best if you start implementing it before you need to. Ideally, you’d start using it right before your scalp starts to react to DHT and you notice extra hairs in the drain, a thinning crown, and a receding hairline. Realistically, you’ll be a little late to the party. Because of the way hair loss happens, it’’s a lot easier to maintain the hair that you have that it is to regrow hair once it’s fallen out.

I recommend you start this routine no later than 25. If you have a history of male pattern baldness in your family, I recommend starting it ever sooner, maybe even in high school.

### You have to be realistic

This is a routine to keep existing hair. While there is evidence that some people have regrowth—and it can be quite significant in some cases—it’s better to assume that you’ll be a case of someone who merely stops hair loss and experiences a low/moderate amount of regrowth.

If you’re at Norwood stage 5, then you can’t expect this protocol to get you back to a full head of hair. It can, however, stop things from getting worse and it might give you significant regrowth.

### You’ll have to spend some money

But not nearly as much money as you’ll have to spend on a hair transplant.&nbsp;

Granted, I am pleased with the results of my FUE hair transplant (**you can read all about it here—&gt;[My experience getting an FUE transplant](/my-personal-experience-getting-an-fue-hair-transplant/)**), but that is nearly $20k I could have used for something else. That’s ok, though, because of the next point.

### You have to be a vain

I don’t think vanity is a bad thing. Like many traits, it’s only a problem if let it get out of control. You have to care enough about your appearance to spend the money and stay consistent. Some guys can’t imagine why I’d spend the money and time maintaining a full head of hair.&nbsp;

These guys usually just let nature take its course, eventually resorting to just shaving it all off. However, I know the power of appearances and I know that I simply look better with a full crown and sharp hairline.

With all of those things out of the way, here is the routine I use to maintain the hair I have left now that I’ve replaced enough to care about keeping what’s left.

## Wide overview of how this protocol stops early hair loss

The strategic aims of the hair loss prevention/retention plan are as follows:

* Regulate the body’s natural production of DHT (i.e., no ingestion of finasteride/propecia)
* Neutralize and overpower the effect of DHT in the scalp
* Address insulin resistance
* Address inflammation

This will be accomplished for a fraction of the cost of a full-blown FUE transplant.

Even the most expensive version of this protocol will cost less than $100/month and it will \*definitely\* (95-99%) stop your hair loss. It will \*almost certainly” (70-95%) thicken the hair you have remaining (why this program is ideal for catching hair loss early, and it has a \*pretty good chance\* (50-60%) of regrowing your hair.

If you want the scientific reasoning behind this protocol, then the next few sections are for you. However, if just want to get to the protocol, you can skip ahead by clicking here—&gt;The Hair Retention Protocol.

### A simple, not too technical, explanation of how DHT works

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a derivative of testosterone. About 10% of the testosterone in the body is converted to DHT with the help of the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase (5AR). DHT can link to your hair follicles and cause them to shrink. While this is obviously an undesirable outcome, DHT is vital hormone for masculinity.&nbsp;

DHT contributes to male secondary sex characteristics such as:

* a deep voice
* body hair and muscle growth
* growth of the penis, scrotum, and testicles&nbsp;
* Male fat storage patterns&nbsp;

If we lower DHT in the whole body, we essentially erase a vital chemical component of what makes a man a man. Proof of this is what happens when you lower DHT levels. You display traits such as

* Loss of body hair
* Gynecomastia
* Decreased libido
* Increased weight gain

These changes are the reason why I’m against taking Propecia or finasteride to slow down hair loss. I like a nice full of head as much as the next guy, but I’m not willing suffer through those side effects to get my hair back. Put another way, the costs of finesteride exceeds its value.

**\[screenshot of study showing why low DHT makes beard growth impossible\]**

DHT binds with androgen receptors, and it’s been found that there are both more androgen receptors and DHT in the scalp where balding occurs than in the areas resistant to balding. This is why the hair in these areas almost never falls out and are used as the donor site for hair transplants.

Experts believe that hair loss occurs due to increased concentrations of both 5-alpha-reductase and androgen receptions, they are not sure exactly how it works. The probable theory put forth is that the same gene which controls the hair follicles growth cycle is influenced by the androgen DHT([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6989660/)).

While the following is causative, it’s strong correlation and confirms why certain treatments work and others are just snake oil: **\[insert screenshot from study\]**

It’s also worth noting that there are negatives when DHT levels in the body are too high. High levels of DHT cause acne, a receding hair line, and hair loss at the crown. The last two issues make sense and is what this article is devoted to stopping, but the acne is issue is one that many people outside of the bodybuilding world aren’t familiar with.

Many guys who are on steroids that increase testosterone (and thus increase DHT conversion) get acne for exactly this reason. Their testosterone levels are elevated so now their bodies have more testosterone to convert to DHT. Those this can happen naturally as well from increases in muscle and lowering body fat (activities which increase testosterone), back acne is typically the result of artificially inflated levels of testosterone being converted to DHT.

### A simple explanation of the role of inflammation and fungus in male pattern baldness

DHT gets all the attention for male pattern baldness (and rightfully so), so many people are completely unaware of inflammation’s role in hair loss. We know from [research like this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7667670/) that inflammation plays a significant role in hair loss.

In that research, the majority of scalp samples had elevated levels of lymphocytes, histiocytes, mast cells, and CD4 t cells. The presence of these all signify that a significant part of losing hair is the collateral damage between your immune system and fungus and microbes in the environment.

If you’ve never heard this before, it might sound far fetched, but the main cause of dandruff is not actually dry skin. It’s a fungus known as malassezia and it exists on the scalp of most adults. Now, if most people have this fungus on their scalp but not everyone suffers from a receding crown or temples, then what’s going on here?

Well, it’s not exactly that fungus but it’s some fungus. And we know that by treating the scalp with antimicrobials and antifungals, we promote hair regrowth and a decrease of the markers of inflammation. [From this study on treatment with antimicrobial and antifungal lotion](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639609086877)\:

*Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a common yet poorly understood condition. In particular, the significance of inflammatory cells close to the infrainfundibulum of transitional hairs remains obscure. This study was conducted in 20 men who used a lotion containing the antimicrobials, piroctone olamine and triclosan, regularly for 18 months. At entry, mild pruritus and abnormal hair loss were reported by the volunteers. During treatment, pruritus resolved rapidly. Comparison of clinical photographs and trichograms taken at 3-month intervals suggested signs of hair regrowth with moderate increase in density of transitional hairs.*

### A simple take on the role of insulin resistance in hair loss

Insulin resistance is when your muscles, fat, and liver doesn’t respond well to insulin and can’t easily take up glucose from your blood. As a result, your pancreas makes more insulin to help glucose enter your cells.

Insulin resistance is always accompanied by another condition called “hyperinsulinemia,” which means “elevated insulin.” This makes sense, as the pancreas must continue to keep your insulin levels elevated to deal with the glucose in your bloodstream.

Many men are insulin resistant. Numbers range from 15-40% of the worldwide population has some level of insulin resistance ([source](https://bmcendocrdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12902-020-00558-9#:~:text=Worldwide%2C%20the%20prevalence%20of%20insulin,to%2046.5%25%2C%20among%20adults.)). In the United States, where most of the readers of this article will reside, 40% of young adults are insulin resistant ([source](https://www.uab.edu/news/research/item/12289-uab-researchers-find-that-40-percent-of-young-american-adults-have-insulin-resistance-and-cardiovascular-risk-factors)).

Many men also suffer from alopecia. This doesn’t necessarily mean that one causes the other. To determine that, we need a plausible mechanism of action. Something that could link the two beyond mere correlation. Fortunately, we have that.

We know that male pattern baldness is a side effect of useful androgen DHT in the bloodstream that interacts with the hair follicles, causing them to miniaturize. Hyperinsulinemia also causes an increase in serum androgen levels, including levels of DHT ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8107978/)). This relationship alone is enough to justify the role of insulin resistance in male pattern hair loss, but there is one more significant problem caused by insulin resistance.&nbsp;

Lastly, it is known that studies have shown a “significant reduction in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels in bald men” ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6684473/)). As the name suggests, SHBG is the protein that sex hormones bind to as they transport around the body. As a reminder, the “androgens” are testosterone and DHT. They, along with estrogen, are “sex hormones.”

[This study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2133.1983.tb03538.x) found that “there was a significant reduction in SHBG levels in bald men, compared with controls.” [This study here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877475/) also found the same thing. One idea here is that&nbsp; Low levels of SHBG have been strongly correalted to an increase in Homestatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) score ([source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cen.12086)).&nbsp;

Lower SHBG results in higher amounts of unbound free testosterone in the blood. From there, the increased free testosterone can be converted into excessive amounts of DHT through 5-alpha reductase. This is the proposed mechanism of low SHGB leading to higher levels of hair loss.&nbsp;
