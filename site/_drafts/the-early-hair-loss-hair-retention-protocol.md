  Do these things to maintain your hair (and even regrow it) IF you catch the
  loss early. This also works great for post-hair transplant retention.

I don’t remember when I started losing my hair. I don’t think most who suffer from male pattern baldness ever do. However, most of us remember when someone else points out that we’re losing hair.

When I was 27, a guy I boxed with pointed out that I was going bald. At age 28, one of my drill sergeants at basic training (I enlisted relatively late) made a joke about it.

I tried minoxidil (Rogaine foam) with hardly any results. I also tried finasteride (Propecia) pills, but I stopped because I got a strange pain in my groin that lined up with a lot of the crazy symptoms I’d read about in regards to Propecia.

Eventually, I got 2 FUE hair transplants and I got back a full head of hair. Except there was only one problem: It’s possible to still lose hair that hadn’t fallen out. This meant that I would need to do something to keep my remaining hair from falling out. From that problem, my hair retention protocol was born.
