I don’t remember when I started losing my hair. I don’t think most who suffer from male pattern baldness ever do. However, most of us remember when someone else points out that we’re losing hair.

When I was 27, a guy I boxed with pointed out that I was going bald. At age 28, one of my drill sergeants at basic training (I enlisted relatively late) made a joke about it.

I tried minoxidil (Rogaine foam) with hardly any results. I also tried finasteride (Propecia) pills, but I stopped because I got a strange pain in my groin that lined up with a lot of the crazy symptoms I’d read about in regards to Propecia.

Eventually, I got 2 FUE hair transplants and I got back a full head of hair. Except there was only one problem: It’s possible to still lose hair that hadn’t fallen out. This meant that I would need to do something to keep my remaining hair from falling out. From that problem, my hair retention protocol was born.

## Warnings about the hair retention protocol

Before I tell you what to do, I have to give you a few caveats about this protocol.&nbsp;

### You have to be patient

It’s possible that when I first tried Minoxidil, I didn’t give it enough time to work. With that said, it’s widely known that Minoxidil works best at slowing down hair loss and hair shedding. Most people don’t experience regrowth. I could have been one of the guys that experience hair regrowth, but I just didn’t stick with it long enough to find out.

The hair retentional protocol has a fairly high success rate but is not instantaneous. It will take 6-12 months for any noticeable changes to happen. You’ll stop losing hair almost immediately, so things shouldn’t get much worse (except for the temporary shedding), but it takes a small amount of time for things to get better.

### You have to be early

This protocol works best if you start implementing it before you need to. Ideally, you’d start using it right before your scalp starts to react to DHT and you notice extra hairs in the drain, a thinning crown, and a receding hairline. Realistically, you’ll be a little late to the party. Because of the way hair loss happens, it’’s a lot easier to maintain the hair that you have that it is to regrow hair once it’s fallen out.

I recommend you start this routine no later than 25. If you have a history of male pattern baldness in your family, I recommend starting it ever sooner, maybe even in high school.

### You have to be realistic

This is a routine to keep existing hair. While there is evidence that some people have regrowth—and it can be quite significant in some cases—it’s better to assume that you’ll be a case of someone who merely stops hair loss and experiences a low/moderate amount of regrowth.

If you’re at Norwood stage 5, then you can’t expect this protocol to get you back to a full head of hair. It can, however, stop things from getting worse and it might give you significant regrowth.

### You’ll have to spend some money

But not nearly as much money as you’ll have to spend on a hair transplant.&nbsp;

Granted, I am pleased with the results of my FUE hair transplant (**you can read all about it here—&gt;[My experience getting an FUE transplant](/my-personal-experience-getting-an-fue-hair-transplant/)**), but that is nearly $20k I could have used for something else. That’s ok, though, because of the next point.

### You have to be a vain

I don’t think vanity is a bad thing. Like many traits, it’s only a problem if let it get out of control. You have to care enough about your appearance to spend the money and stay consistent. Some guys can’t imagine why I’d spend the money and time maintaining a full head of hair.&nbsp;

These guys usually just let nature take its course, eventually resorting to just shaving it all off. However, I know the power of appearances and I know that I simply look better with a full crown and sharp hairline.

With all of those things out of the way, here is the routine I use to maintain the hair I have left now that I’ve replaced enough to care about keeping what’s left.

## Wide overview of how this protocol stops early hair loss

The strategic aims of the hair loss prevention/retention plan are as follows:

* Regulate the body’s natural production of DHT (i.e., no ingestion of finasteride/propecia)
* Neutralize and overpower the effect of DHT in the scalp
* Address insulin resistance
* Address inflammation

This will be accomplished for a fraction of the cost of a full-blown FUE transplant.

Even the most expensive version of this protocol will cost less than $100/month and it will \*definitely\* (95-99%) stop your hair loss. It will \*almost certainly” (70-95%) thicken the hair you have remaining (why this program is ideal for catching hair loss early, and it has a \*pretty good chance\* (50-60%) of regrowing your hair.
