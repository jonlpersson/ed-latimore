The Tao of Jeet Kune Do was perhaps Bruce Lee’s greatest contribution to the world of martial arts. He began writing the book in 1970 while he was recovering from a back injury that nearly ruined his acting career before it even got started.

The book is essentially a treatise on all aspects of fighting. Specifically, it was a combination of Bruce Lee’s notes and commentaries on the fighting system he was developing (Jeet Kune Do or "JKD” for short) and a comparison of it to other fighting systems.

Bruce Lee kept various notes throughout the development of his fighting system that would also be used in The book. Many of these notes were "sudden inspirations" which were incomplete and lacked any kind of a construct. The combination of the "core set of writings" and the "disparate notes" are what make up the text Tao of Jeet Kune Do.

As a result, the book doesn’t read like a narrative or even a complete work. Rather, it’s a set of observations and notes, written in a flowing style, as Bruce captured many of these inspirations sporadically.

The Tao of Jeet Kune Do is one of my favorite books because fighting is an excellent analogy for my many things life, and Bruce Lee captures many poignant observations from martial arts that apply to many areas of life.

Below I’ve collected my favorite quotes from The Tao of Jeet Kune Do along with my own extrapolations and explanations. This book is a must-have for any martial artist or philosopher out there.

## **Self-Knowledge**

* ***"The consciousness of self is the greatest hindrance to the proper execution of all physical action."***<br><br>Most people aren't thinking about you. In fact, most people don't even know that you exist. You're worried about looking foolish or falling out of favor with them, and it's keeping you from executing in your life.<br><br>One day they'll die. So will you. What they think is ephemeral. What they do is is ephemeral. These conditions apply to you as well. Don't let something temporary and meaningless ruin your temporary and meaningless time on this planet.
* ***"Relationship is understanding. It is a process of self-revelation. Relationship is the mirror in which you discover yourself — to be is to be related."***<br><br>We only develop and learn about ourselves in relation to other people. We learn the most vital skill, communication—verbal and non-verbal—by constantly interaction with others.<br><br>We learn to love, respect, care for, and empathize by interacting with others. Even our aims in competition, to defeat and overtake, also depend on understanding our opponent. And how we treat that opponent determines whether or not they become our enemy.&nbsp;
* "**Self-expression is total, immediate, without conception of time, and you can only express that if you are free, physically and mentally, from fragmentation."**<br><br>Whenever you hold part of yourself back, you're holding all of yourself back. Expression is only possible when the totalality of your being is free to be. Practical speaking, this is expressed in the idea of the saying "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link."<br><br>​​​What this means is that you can only be as effective as the most ineffective part of you. While you may get lucky a few times at the beginning, as the stakes get higher more of your weaknesses will revealed as more of you will be demanded to meet the challenges you face.&nbsp;
* **"To know oneself is to study oneself in action with another person."**<br><br>We can learn a lot from observing how we interact with other people, but in a rather unsuspecting manner. When a character trait in another person pleases you, it's one that you wish you had. When a character trait in another person annoys you, it's one that you have and haven't made peace with yet.<br><br>In this way, one of the highest forms of self-development is awareness of the reactions you have when interacting with other people. &nbsp;

## **The state of mind to see the truth**

* **"To obtain enlightenment in martial art means the extinction of everything which obscures the 'true knowledge,' the 'real-life.'"**<br><br>When you remove what's in the way, then the way becomes passable. When you remove what blocks your sight, then all things become visible. Rather than focus on getting more to do more, it is likely a worthwhile investment to start removing and reducing what is in your way.<br><br>This way, there is nothing left to keep you from your goals. Sometimes the solution isn't to do more or try harder. It is be more effective and efficiency and to focus on removing what's unnecessary or intrusive.
* **"The oneness of all life is a truth that can be fully realized only when false notions of a separate self, whose destiny can be considered apart from the whole, are forever annihilated."**<br><br>The fastest way to know the truth is to stop harboring falsehoods.&nbsp; In this way, whatever is left is real, honest, and true. When you can do this, then you no longer be threatened by anything, because only that which is vulnerable and temporary can be threatened and the truth is neither of those things.<br><br>This reminds me of a line from one of my favorite books, The Course in Miracles: "No real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists." The goal is to only focus on what is real to you. If you do this to the best of your ability, you will always know peace, even if you accidentally align yourself with the counterfeit.&nbsp;
* **"To see a thing uncolored by one’s own personal preferences and desires is to see it in its own pristine simplicity."**<br><br>Everything you see and experience is not pure. It is filtered through your own perceptions, experiences, and expectations. Furthermore, merely by taking part or observing something, you influence the properties you observe. It's impossible to observe something without becoming part of what you're observing.&nbsp;<br><br>This idea has an analog in physics, called the uncertainty principle. The act of measuring always influences what's being measured. The same olds true for our perceptions. The idea then, is to reduce our perception as much as possible to get as close to honestly seeing what's in front of us as possible.&nbsp;

## **Formless artistry**

* "Art is an expression of life and transcends both time and space. We must employ our own souls through art to give a new form and a new meaning to nature or the world."
* **"Art is never decoration, embellishment; instead, it is a work of enlightenment. Art, in other words, is a technique for acquiring liberty."**<br><br>True artists never create for the sake of vanity. They may have developed a sense of vanity towards themselves, but the work is never created in vain. This is a valuable lesson about art and how one can add more of an artistic flair to their life.<br><br>To create art, all of you have to do is create with the intention of freeing your ideas and emotions from the restrictive cage of your mind and heart. If you view creation as an act of liberation of your most deeply cherish thoughts and feelings, then you have the ability to artistically express yourself in a variety of vocations.<br><br>​​​​​​​You don't need an canvas or a musical instrument. You simply need the tools of your trade and intention.
* "Art calls for complete mastery of techniques, developed by reflection within the soul."

## **Martial arts analogies to life**

* "The great mistake is to anticipate the outcome of the engagement; you ought not to think of whether it ends in victory or defeat. Let nature take its course, and your tools will strike at the right moment."
* "While being trained, the student is to be active and dynamic in every way. But in actual combat, his mind must be calm and not at all disturbed. He must feel as if nothing critical is happening."
* "Instead of facing combat in its suchness, then, most systems of martial art accumulate a “fancy mess” that distorts and cramps their practitioners and distracts them from the actual reality of combat, which is simple and direct. Instead of going immediately to the heart of things, flowery forms (organized despair) and artificial techniques are ritualistically practiced to simulate actual combat. Thus, instead of “being” in combat these practitioners are “doing” something “about” combat."
* "When you get down to it, real combat is not fixed and is very much “alive.” The fancy mess (a form of paralysis) solidifies and conditions what was once fluid, and when you look at it realistically, it is nothing but a blind devotion to the systematic uselessness of practicing routines or stunts that lead nowhere."
* "The fighter is to always be single-minded with one object in view—to fight, looking neither backward nor sideways. He must get rid of obstructions to his forward movement, emotionally, physically or intellectually."

## **Patterns and systems**

* "Set patterns, incapable of adaptability, of pliability, only offer a better cage. Truth is outside of all patterns."
* "One can function freely and totally if he is “beyond the system.” The man who is really serious, with the urge to find out what truth is, has no style at all. He lives only in what is."

## **Total comprehension**

* **"The height of cultivation runs to simplicity. Half-way cultivation runs to ornamentation."**<br><br>You understand a subject well when you no longer overcomplicate your explanation of it. You've grasped a skill when you no longer make extra moves while executing. You've mastered your emotions when you experience as long as necessary, and no longer.<br><br>A sign of cultivation is efficiency and a sign of efficiency is simplicity. However, when you don't know something well enough to simplify, you're left but no choice but to make it more complicated. This often isn't intentional. Rather, it's merely the result of confusion and inefficient connections between the supporting skills and knowledge.<br><br>This can only be fixed with training, reflection, and repetition.&nbsp;
* **"We shall find the truth when we examine the problem. The problem is never apart from the answer. The problem is the answer — understanding the problem dissolves the problem."**<br><br>What you will find is that any problem you have, the solution is embedded in that problem. This isn't is complicated, unbelievable, or profound as it seems. The problem is telling you exactly where you need to focus your attention.<br><br>This is especially true for personal problems. Your ego often prevents you from seeing the solution because that often means admitting your role in creating the calamity. And once you can accept the role that you've played, then you have to accept the burden of what it will take to fix..&nbsp;
* **"Awareness has no frontier; it is a giving of your whole being, without exclusion. Concentration is a narrowing down of the mind. But we are concerned with the total process of living and to concentrate exclusively on any particular aspect of life, belittles life."**<br><br>All of life is important. Lee is telling us to not neglect any part of our development. More specifically, he's warning us to not overly concentrate on any particular part of life.&nbsp;<br>​​<br>This means that your family, should be no more important than your business, should no more important than your health, should be no more important than your citizenship, and so on. All areas of your life need to be at a basic level of functionality for you to get the most out of living.&nbsp;
