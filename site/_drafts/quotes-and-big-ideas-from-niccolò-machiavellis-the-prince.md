The Price was written by Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli in 1513 as a sort of instruction guide for new renaissance rulers. He wrote it in exile, hoping to return to a position of power he once held. **He wrote The Prince to gain favor with Lorenzo de Medici** after he fell out of favor with them because he was accused of conspiracy.

Machiavelli states in the book's dedication that he would like to return to a position of authority and that he offers the advice contained in The Prince as the most precious gift he could offer.

Machiavelli himself was an Italian diplomat and political theorist we can assume from the text is well educated in the history, rise, and fall of various rules and kingdoms throughout history.

Throughout The Prince, Machiavelli references everyone from Alexander the Great, to Pope Alexander the VI, to Cesare Borgia to make his case for a type of amoral, results-driven, course of action for new Princes to take. He draws on experience as a diplomat to warn about the pitfalls of human nature and how to manipulate it to achieve your political goals.

He is particularly impressed and inspired by Cesare Borgia saying of him, "There was one man who showed glimpses of greatness, the kind of thing that made you think he was sent by God for the country's redemption."

Although it is relatively short, the book has made a serious impression on popular culture and political philosophy. It’s responsible for bringing the word "Machiavellian" into usage as an insult to one’s character.

I've collected the big ideas and major quotes from Machiavelli's classic treatise on political philosophy and political theory. I wouldn't exactly call these inspirational quotes, but you will find a wealth of practical knowledge that will enable you to navigate and anticipate human nature to use to your advantage.

## **Machiavelli on maintaining power after victory**

True it is that when a State rebels and is again got under, it will not afterward be lost so easily.&nbsp;

---

He, therefore, who acquires such a State, if he means to keep it, must see to two things; first, that the blood of the ancient line of Princes is destroyed; second, that no change be made in respect of laws or taxes; for in this way the newly acquired State speedily becomes incorporated with the hereditary.&nbsp;

---

And let it here be noted that men are either to be kindly treated, or utterly crushed since they can revenge lighter injuries, but not graver. Wherefore the injury we do to a man should be of a sort to leave no fear of reprisals.&nbsp;

---

And let it be noted that there is no more delicate matter to take in hand, nor more dangerous to conduct, nor more doubtful in its success, than to set up as a leader in the introduction of changes. For he who innovates will have for his enemies all those who are well off under the existing order of things and only lukewarm supporters in those who might be better off under the new.&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

Must not fail to remind the Prince who acquires a new State through the favor of its inhabitants, to weigh well what were the causes which led those who favored him to do so; and if it is seen that they have acted not from any natural affection for him, but merely out of discontent with the former government, that he will find the greatest difficulty in keeping them his friends since it will be impossible for him to content them.&nbsp;

---

He will perceive that it is far easier to secure the friendship of those who being satisfied with things as they stood, were for that very reason his enemies than of those who sided with him and aided him in his usurpation only because they were discontented.

---

For, in truth, there is no sure way of holding other than by destroying, and whoever becomes master of a city accustomed to living in freedom and does not destroy it, may reckon on being destroyed by it.

## Machiavelli on dealing with problems early

For when you are on the spot, disorders are detected in their beginnings and remedies can be readily applied; but when you are at a distance, they are not heard of until they have gathered strength and the case is past cure. (fixing problems)

**Hence we may learn the lesson that on seizing a state, the usurper should make haste to inflict what injuries he must, at a stroke, that he may not have to renew them daily but be enabled by their discontinuance to reassure men’s minds, and afterward win them over by benefits. (fixing problems)**

&nbsp;

**Nevertheless, the ruler is not truly wise who cannot discern evils before they develop themselves, and this is a faculty given to few. (fixing problems)**

Wherefore, as has already been said, a Prince who is ignorant of military affairs, besides other disadvantages, can neither be respected by his soldiers, nor can he trust them. A Prince, therefore, ought never to allow his attention to be diverted from warlike pursuits, and should occupy himself with them even more in peace than in war. This he can do in two ways, by practice or by study. (fixing problems)

And there is no quality so self-destructive as liberality; for while you practise it you lose the means whereby it can be practised, and become poor and despised, or else, to avoid poverty, you become rapacious and hated. For liberality leads to one or other of these two results, against which, beyond all others, a Prince should guard. (Fixing problems)

**A Prince should therefore disregard the reproach of being thought cruel where it enables him to keep his subjects united and obedient. For he who quells disorder by a very few signal examples will in the end be more merciful than he who from too great leniency permits things to take their course and so to result in rapine and bloodshed; for these hurt the whole State, whereas the severities of the Prince injure individuals only. (fixing problems)**

**For of men it may generally be affirmed, that they are thankless, fickle, false studious to avoid danger, greedy of gain, devoted to you while you are able to confer benefits upon them, and ready, as I said before, while danger is distant, to shed their blood, and sacrifice their property, their lives, and their children for you; but in the hour of need they turn against you.** (Fixing problems)

**For a man may very well be feared and yet not hated, and this will be the case so long as he does not meddle with the property or with the women of his citizens and subjects. And if constrained to put any to death, he should do so only when there is a manifest cause or reasonable justification. But, above all, he must abstain from the property of others. For men will sooner forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony. (fixing problems, managing people)**

Returning to the question of being loved or feared, I sum up by saying, that since his being loved depends upon his subjects, while his being feared depends upon himself, a wise Prince should build on what is his own, and not on what rests with others. Only, as I have said, he must do his utmost to escape hatred. **(fixing problems, managing people)**

Be it known, then, that there are two ways of contending, one in accordance with the laws, the other by force; the first of which is proper to men, the second to beasts. But since the first method is often ineffectual, it becomes necessary to resort to the second. **(fixing problems, managing people)**

**But since a Prince should know how to use the beast’s nature wisely, he ought of beasts to choose both the lion and the fox; for the lion cannot guard himself from the toils, nor the fox from wolves. He must therefore be a fox to discern toils, and a lion to drive off wolves. (fixing problems, managing people)**

## Machiavelli on managing reputation

**The wish to acquire is no doubt a natural and common sentiment, and when men attempt things within their power, they will always be praised rather than blamed. But when they persist in attempts that are beyond their power, mishaps and blame ensue. (perception of power)**

And here comes the question of whether it is better to be loved rather than feared, or feared rather than loved. It might perhaps be answered that we should wish to be both; but since love and fear can hardly exist together if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved. **(power of reputation and appearance)**

**It is not essential, then, that a Prince should have all the good qualities which I have enumerated above, but it is most essential that he should seem to have them; I will even venture to affirm that if he has and invariably practices them all, they are hurtful, whereas the appearance of having them is useful. Thus, it is well to seem merciful, faithful, humane, religious, and upright, and also to be so; but the mind should remain so balanced that were it needful not to be so, you should be able and know how to change to the contrary. (power of reputation and appearance)**

**For if he well consider the whole matter, he will find that there may be a line of conduct having the appearance of virtue, to follow which would be his ruin, and that there may be another course having the appearance of vice, by following which his safety and well-being are secured. (power of reputation and appearance)**

## **Machiavelli on paying for help**

&nbsp;

Mercenaries and auxiliaries are at once useless and dangerous, and he who holds his State by means of mercenary troops can never be solidly or securely seated. For such troops are disunited, ambitious, insubordinate, treacherous, insolent among friends, cowardly before foes, and without fear of God or faith with man. Whenever they are attacked defeat follows; so that in peace you are plundered by them, in war by your enemies. And this is because they have no tie or motive to keep them in the field beyond their paltry pay, in return for which it would be too much to expect them to give their lives. (paying for help)

**Captains of mercenaries are either able men or they are not. If they are, you cannot trust them, since they will always seek their own aggrandizement, either by overthrowing you who are their master or by the overthrow of others contrary to your desire. On the other hand, if your captain be not an able man the chances are you will be ruined.** (paying for help)

For the gains resulting from mercenary arms are slow, and late, and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and astounding. (paying for help)

**In short, with mercenaries, your greatest danger is from their inertness and cowardice, with auxiliaries from their valor. Wise Princes, therefore, have always eschewed these arms, and trusted rather to their own, and have preferred defeat with the latter to victory with the former, counting that as no true victory which is gained by foreign aid.** (paying for help)

For the friendships which we buy with a price, and do not gain by greatness and nobility of character, though they be fairly earned are not made good, but fail us when we have occasion to use them. (paying for help)

## Machiavellian tactics in modern politics

You ought never to suffer your designs to be crossed in order to avoid war, since war is not so to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage.

Wherefore, a wise Prince should devise means whereby his subjects may at all times, whether favorable or adverse, feel the need of the State and of him, and then they will always be faithful to him. (modern politics)

To govern more securely some Princes have disarmed their subjects, others have kept the towns subject to them divided by factions; some have fostered hostility against themselves. (modern politics)

For I do not believe that divisions purposely caused can ever lead to good; on the contrary, when an enemy approaches, divided cities are lost at once, for the weaker faction will always side with the invader, and the other will not be able to stand alone. (modern politics)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

But while it was their opportunities that made these men fortunate, it was their own merit that enabled them to recognize these opportunities and turn them to account, to the glory and prosperity of their country. They who come to the Princedom, as these did, by virtuous paths, acquire with difficulty, but keep with ease.

&nbsp;

They who from a private station become Princes by mere good fortune, do so with little trouble but have much trouble to maintain themselves. Such Princes are wholly dependent on the favor and fortunes of those who have made them great, than which supports none could be less stable or secure; and they lack both the knowledge and the power that would enable them to maintain their position.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Add to this, that a Prince can never secure himself against a disaffected people, their number being too great, while he may against a disaffected nobility, since their number is small. The worst that a Prince need fear from a disaffected people is, that they may desert him, whereas when the nobles are his enemies he has to fear not only that they may desert him, but also that they may turn against him; because, as they have greater craft and foresight, they always choose their time to suit their safety, and seek favor with the side they think will win. Again, a Prince must always live with the same people, but need not always live with the same nobles, being able to make and unmake these from day to day, and give and take away their authority at his pleasure. (managing your enemies)

&nbsp;

**Men are always averse to enterprises that are attended to with difficulty, and it is impossible not to foresee difficulties in attacking a Prince whose town is strongly fortified and who is not hated by his subjects.**

\*\*A Prince, therefore, who has a strong city, and who does not make himself hated, can not be attacked, or should he be so, his assailant will come badly off; since human affairs are so variable that it is almost impossible for anyone to keep an army posted in leaguer for a whole year without interruption of some sort. \*\*

And here I would call to mind a passage in the Old Testament as bearing on this point. When David offered himself to Saul to go forth and fight Goliath the Philistine champion, Saul encouraged him armed him with his own armor, which David, so soon as he had put it on, rejected, saying that with these untried arms he could not prevail and that he chose rather to meet his enemy with only his sling and his sword. In a word, the armor of others is too wide, or too strait for us; it falls off us, or it weighs us down.

&nbsp;

**Moreover, men are less careful how they offend him who makes himself loved than him who makes himself feared. For love is held by the tie of obligation, which, because men are a sorry breed, is broken on every whisper of private interest; but fear is bound by the apprehension of punishment which never relaxes its grasp. Nevertheless, a Prince should inspire fear in such a fashion that if he does not win love he may escape hate. (power of reputation and appearance)**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Not to be hated or despised by the body of his subjects, is one of the surest safeguards that a Prince can have against conspiracy. For he who conspires always reckons on pleasing the people by putting the Prince to death; but when he sees that instead of pleasing he will offend them, he cannot summon the courage to carry out his design. (fixing problems, managing people)**

**To be brief, a Prince has little to fear from conspiracies when his subjects are well disposed towards him; but when they are hostile and hold him in detestation, he has then reason to fear everything and everyone. (fixing problems, managing people)**

**So that, on the whole, the best fortress you can have, is in not being hated by your subjects. If they hate you no fortress will save you; for when once the people take up arms, foreigners are never wanting to assist them. (managing people, fixing problems)**

And it will always happen that he who is not your friend will invite you to neutrality, while he who is your friend will call on you to declare yourself openly in arms. (managing people)

And here let it be noted that a Prince should be careful never to join with one stronger than himself in attacking others, unless, as already said, he be driven to it by necessity. For if he whom you join prevails, you are at his mercy. (managing people)

**For there is no way to guard against flattery but by letting it be seen that you take no offense in hearing the truth (managing people)**

Men will always grow rogues on your hands unless they find themselves under a necessity to be honest.

**A Prince who rests wholly on Fortune is ruined when she changes.**

For no man is found so prudent as to know how to adapt himself to these changes, both because he cannot deviate from the course to which nature inclines him, and because, having always prospered while adhering to one path, he cannot be persuaded that it would be well for him to forsake it. And so when occasion requires the cautious man to act impetuously, he cannot do so and is undone: whereas, had he changed his nature with time and circumstances, his fortune would have been unchanged.

**To be brief, I say that since Fortune changes and men stand fixed in their old ways, they are prosperous so long as there is congruity between them, and the reverse when there is not.**

Of this, however, I am well persuaded, that it is better to be impetuous than cautious. For Fortune is a woman who to be kept under must be beaten and roughly handled; and we see that she suffers herself to be more readily mastered by those who so treat her than by those who are more timid in their approaches. And always, like a woman, she favours the young, because they are less scrupulous and fiercer, and command her with greater audacity.
