I’m a former National Champion amateur boxer and top-level professional heavyweight boxer who still regularly has intense training sessions, sparring sessions, and coaches aspiring amateur fighters. I even work with people who just want to try the sport out&nbsp; Because of my experience as a professional boxer and a coach, I can give you a unique perspective on the best boxing gloves you can buy to start your boxing journey.

I put this list together under the assumption that you will take your training seriously.

I’m not saying that you have to become a professional boxer. I just don’t see any difference between beginner’s boxing gloves and training gloves that experienced boxers practice in.

If you take up the sport of boxing, you should have high-quality gear. This means owning some excellent gloves. With this in mind and from looking over other articles (not written by professional boxers, mind you), this article is organized as follows:

I’ll give my best recommendations for the different situations and scenarios you encounter in a boxing gym. My recommendations are broken down by style of glove, purpose or glove, and price. I've said it already, but I’ll repeat it because I feel that it’s THAT important:

Anyone in the boxing gym needs high-quality pair of boxing gloves. Or, at the very least, you have to ensure that you have the best gloves they can afford. It doesn’t matter whether you’re:

* An amateur boxer
* A professional boxer
* Using boxing workouts at home or in the gym to get in shape
* Just trying out the sweet science as a hobby

This list is for you. More importantly, this list is timeless.

Other lists that recommend gloves are put together just to make an affiliate commission. They're written by people who have never even stepped into a boxing gym, let alone ever taken a fight. As a result, they think the recommendations for good gloves change each year. Or worse, they only recommend brands that offer a commission (many of the top brands don't offer a commission),

This article has my recommendations, but I also devoted a lot of space devoted to teaching you how to select gloves for sparring, gloves for training, or boxing gloves to just hit the heavy bag with. This way, if you don’t like my recommendations, you at least don’t buy a low-quality boxing glove.

And lastly, if my recommendations help you to make a decision, I’d love for you to purchase through my link. I’ll get a small affiliate commission at no extra cost to you.

## A word to other combat sports athletes and legit fighters

I’m not an MMA guy, but I’ve worked with enough legit fighters to tell you that this list works for you as well, but with a small caveat. MMA gloves are small and are open-palm. While I wouldn’t recommend hitting the heavy bag with MMA gloves, some guys do.

With that said, my recommendations for bag gloves will be suitable for you as well. If you’re just training your stand-up sparring or doing a bag workout, these boxing glove recommendations hold for you as well.

For the kickboxers and Muay Thai guys, this list works for you, as those disciplines also use boxing gloves. This isn’t necessarily true for all martial arts that use sparring gloves (karate gloves are closer to mixed martial arts gloves than boxing gloves, in my opinion).&nbsp; I’m not familiar with all of the different martial arts practices out there, so make sure you do your homework.

Also, this article was written with teenagers and older in mind.

As I’m writing this article by testing bag and fighting gloves and my own collection, I don’t have any recommendations for children’s gloves. That said, most fighting gloves don’t work based on age but rather on hand size.

Most of my recommendations here have a sizing option for children. At the very least, a basic sizing chart can help determine the best size. **\[put in sizing chart\]**

For everyone else, I know that buying boxing gloves for the first time is a daunting task. There are so many brands and so many recommendations. So, I don’t claim that my recommendations are the best, but they come from my experience as a boxer and some feedback from other legit fighters.

On top of that, rather than just putting together a list of fighting gloves for traffic and affiliate sales, I actually own all the gloves I mentioned or I tested them extensively, either for this article or in the past.
