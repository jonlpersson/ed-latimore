I tried the Alpha Brain supplement for 30 days. To test out its efficacy, I watched my progress on 3 of my regular cognitive tasks:

* **Writing content.** I'm currently growing my Substack ([Sign up here for other writings of mine](https://edlatimore.substack.com/)), working on a book, and producing content for this site.
* **Training chess.** I have a long-term goal of attain master strength in chess. [Here's part of my training plan.](/chess-improvement-plan/)
* **Practicing Spanish.** By the end of the year, the goal is to take the D.E.L.E. exam for Spanish level B2

Given that I'm currently in the state of constant sleep deprevation that all new-parents go through, I figured that I'd be a perfect candidate to see just how this supplement stacks up a brain boosting nootropic.

The rest of this article goes into detail and gives a little background into the supplement, but I'll give you a small spoiler alert:&nbsp;

This is one of the best nootropics you can buy that is not a neuropeptide or over-the-counter medication.

Even if you trusted my word enough to buy from that alone, you should still keep reading to learn more about how Alpha Brain supports memory, improves cognitive performance, and increases your mental processing speed of information.

I also give you information on the history of the company, its founder Marcus Aubrey, and what lead him to create Onnit Labs and help thousands improve their physical and mental performance.

Let’s get into it!

## What is Alpha Brain and where did it come from?

Alpha Brain is a nootropic supplement created by Onnit, a health and wellness company founded by Aubrey Marcus in 2010. The idea for Alpha Brain originated when Marcus began experimenting with various cognitive-enhancing supplements and nootropics in order to improve his own mental performance.

After being unimpressed and dissatisfied with the available options on the market at the time, he figured it was just time to make his own.

To develop Alpha Brain, Marcus worked with a team of scientists and experts in neuroscience, nutrition, and biochemistry. They researched various natural compounds that could enhance cognitive function and memory and eventually developed a formula that doesn’t include anything new on the market but combines them in a way that is synergistically more effective than any combination on the market.

In 2011, Onnit released Alpha Brain to the public, and it quickly gained a following among individuals looking to improve their cognitive performance. The supplement has been very well covered by the media and is one of the best-known and most popular nootropic supplements on the market.

## Who is Aubrey Marcus, and why does it matter

Aubrey Marcus is an American entrepreneur, author, and podcast host and founder/CEO of Austin, TX based Onnit, a health and wellness company.

Marcus is known for his focus on optimizing human performance. His philosophy is based on the idea that we can all achieve our full potential by focusing on various aspects of our health and well-being, including nutrition, fitness, mindfulness, and personal development.

Marcus has also been recognized for his leadership and entrepreneurship. He has been named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list and featured in numerous media outlets, including Men's Health, The New York Times, and Entrepreneur. This guy is the real deal in terms of fitness and business.

When I did some more research into Aubrey Marcus, I also discovered he’s a poet and a filmmaker. If there was ever someone you’d consider a “Renaissance Man”, Aubrey Marcus would fit the bill.

## Alpha Brain has been tested in clinical trials

The entire supplement was tested. Not a few of the individual ingredients, but the whole thing. This is relatively rare in the supplement world, where the FDA has no regulatory power. Supplements are not required to pass rigorous standards to be sold.

This means that your supplement could be full of sawdust. Supplement companies know that there are no regulations, so they have no real incentive to be honest because no one is checking and good marketing, and a few well-placed anecdotes largely the result of the placebo effect is the hustle du jour.

A 2016 study gave Alpha Brain or a placebo to 63 participants ages 18-35 for six weeks. The people who took Alpha Brain had better verbal recall and cognitive function than the placebo group.

[From the study:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4595564/){: target="_blank"}

> At six weeks, significant improvement was noted in tasks of delayed verbal recall and executive functioning for the Alpha BRAIN® group compared to placebo (p &lt; 0.05)...Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to assess the impact of randomization on neuropsychological outcome measures across time points. Results indicated significant interaction effects for improvement in delayed verbal recall for the AlphaBrain(TM) group, *F* (1.61) = 4.07, p &lt; 0.05, partial eta squared =0.06.

In other words, Alpha Brain works.

The word around the internet is that this study was self-funded, and the results of another self-funded study did not return such significant claims. That’s not to say the results are bogus or anything, but it’s always good to be aware of potential sponsorship bias.

Even if the study results don’t influence your decision, the individual ingredients have been tested, and they more or less all contribute to improved mental performance.

## **Alpha Brain Ingredients**

Alpha Brain uses three proprietary blends and two individual ingredients. While the ingredients contained in the proprietary blends are listed, many of their individual doses are not.

I imagine this is done to defend against competitors looking to emulate their specific blend, as proprietary blends aren’t required to list the amount of the individual ingredients included within.

From the [FDA website](https://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplements-guidance-documents-regulatory-information/dietary-supplement-labeling-guide-chapter-iv-nutrition-labeling#4-3){: target="_blank"}\:

***According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FDA requires all supplement manufacturers to list all of the ingredients in a product, on its label along with the appropriate amount of each in terms of weight. BUT! If the ingredients are part of a proprietary blend – the specific amount of each individual ingredient in the proprietary blend does not have to be listed, only the total ***

The list of Alpha Brain ingredients, its three 3 proprietary blends, and their functions are as follows:
