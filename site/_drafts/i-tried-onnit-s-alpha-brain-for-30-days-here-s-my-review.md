I tried the Alpha Brain supplement for 30 days. To test out its efficacy, I watched my progress on 3 of my regular cognitive tasks:

* **Writing content.** I'm currently growing my Substack ([Sign up here for other writings of mine](https://edlatimore.substack.com/)), working on a book, and producing content for this site.
* **Training chess.** I have a long-term goal of attain master strength in chess. [Here's part of my training plan.](/chess-improvement-plan/)
* **Practicing Spanish.** By the end of the year, the goal is to take the D.E.L.E. exam for Spanish level B2

Given that I'm currently in the state of constant sleep deprevation that all new-parents go through, I figured that I'd be a perfect candidate to see just how this supplement stacks up a brain boosting nootropic.

The rest of this article goes into detail and gives a little background into the supplement, but I'll give you a small spoiler alert:&nbsp;

his is one of the best nootropics you can buy that is not a neuropeptide or over-the-counter medication.

Even if you trusted my word enough to buy from that alone, you should still keep reading to learn more about how Alpha Brain supports memory, improves cognitive performance, and increases your mental processing speed of information.

I also give you information on the history of the company, its founder Marcus Aubrey, and what lead him to create Onnit Labs and help thousands improve their physical and mental performance.

Let’s get into it!
