  Propecia has too many adverse effects. Rogaine doesn't work well enough. Hair
  transplants are too expensive. Here is an affordable hair loss solution.

There are only two FDA-approved measures for treating Androgenetic Alopecia (male pattern baldness): Minoxidil (Rogaine) and Finasteride (Propecia). Though I've written about other powerful remedies you can use and effective measures you can take to regrow hair (read about them hereâ€”&gt;[The early hair loss hair retention protocol](/early-hair-loss-hair-retention-method/)), these are the only medications that have produced enough evidence of efficacy in stopping or reversing hair loss to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

However, there are three big problems:

1. Oral finasteride works by manipulating a man's hormone profile. This sometimes has devastating, irreversible consequences and sexual side effects. Oral finasteride, by itself, has a much better success rate than Minoxidil, but it comes it can often come at a steep price.
2. Topical minoxidil and finasteride are excellent at stopping your hair from falling out, but they aren't particularly great at hair regrowth. Part of this is just bad luck. Some men are "hard responders" who don't have a potent reaction to either drug. The other part is that after a certain amount of hair follicle miniaturization, there isn't much that you can do to regrow the hair outside of getting an [FUE hair transplant](/my-personal-experience-getting-an-fue-hair-transplant/) or using a [low-level light therapy laser cap.](/low-level-light-therapy-for-hair-loss/)
3. This last one isn't so much of a problem as it is a general annoyance. To be effective, Rogaine must be applied 2x per day. It also starts with a relatively intense shedding phase, where it seems like your rate of hair loss has accelerated. Also, some guys complain that the Rogaine foam is greasy. I personally don't have this complaint, but I'm a black dude who grew up putting Murray's hair pomade in his hair.

However, there's a new player in the game that has produced much better results than finasteride or minoxidil on their own. It doesn't have \*any\* of the common side effects that have been reported by those who use Propecia. It's also a once-daily application instead of two.

I'm talking about Topical Finasteride+Minoxidil. The rest of this article will talk about my experiences, show some pictures, and break down the science behind one of the most promising (and extremely affordable) hair loss treatment options.
