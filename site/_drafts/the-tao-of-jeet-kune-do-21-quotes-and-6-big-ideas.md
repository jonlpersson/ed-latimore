The Tao of Jeet Kune Do was perhaps Bruce Lee’s greatest contribution to the world of martial arts. He began writing the book in 1970 while he was recovering from a back injury that nearly ruined his acting career before it even got started.

The book is essentially a treatise on all aspects of fighting. Specifically it was a combination of Bruce Lee’s notes and commentaries on the fighting system he was developing (Jeet Kune Do or "JKD” for short) and a comparison of it to other fighting systems.

Bruce Lee kept various notes throughout the development of his fighting system that would also be used in The book. Many of these notes were "sudden inspirations" which were incomplete and lacked any kind of a construct. The combination of the "core set of writings" and the "disparate notes" is what makes up the text Tao of Jeet Kune Do.

As a result, the book doesn’t read like a narrative or even a complete work. Rather, it’s a set of observations and notes, written in a flowing style, as Bruce captured many of these inspirations sporadically.

The Tao of Jeet Kune Do is one of my favorite books because fighting is an excellent analogy for my many things life, and Bruce Lee captures many poignant observations from martial arts that apply to many areas of life.

Below I’ve collected my favorite quotes from The Tao of Jeet Kune Do along with my own extrapolations and explanations. This book is a must-have for any martial artist or philosopher out there.

## 21 quotes and 6 big ideas from The Tao of Jeet Kune Do

## **Self-Knowledge**

* The consciousness of self is the greatest hindrance to the proper execution of all physical action.
* Relationship is understanding. It is a process of self-revelation. Relationship is the mirror in which you discover yourself — to be is to be related.
* Self-expression is total, immediate, without conception of time, and you can only express that if you are free, physically and mentally, from fragmentation.
* To know oneself is to study oneself in action with another person

## **The state of mind to see the truth**

* To obtain enlightenment in martial art means the extinction of everything which obscures the “true knowledge,” the “real life.”
* The oneness of all life is a truth that can be fully realized only when false notions of a separate self, whose destiny can be considered apart from the whole, are forever annihilated.
* To see a thing uncolored by one’s own personal preferences and desires is to see it in its own pristine simplicity.

## **Formless artistry**

* Art is an expression of life and transcends both time and space. We must employ our own souls through art to give a new form and a new meaning to nature or the world.
* Art is never decoration, embellishment; instead, it is a work of enlightenment. Art, in other words, is a technique for acquiring liberty.
* Art calls for complete mastery of techniques, developed by reflection within the soul.

## **Martial arts analogies to life**

* The great mistake is to anticipate the outcome of the engagement; you ought not to be thinking of whether it ends in victory or in defeat. Let nature take its course, and your tools will strike at the right moment.
* While being trained, the student is to be active and dynamic in every way. But in actual combat, his mind must be calm and not at all disturbed. He must feel as if nothing critical is happening.&nbsp;
* Instead of facing combat in its suchness, then, most systems of martial art accumulate a “fancy mess” that distorts and cramps their practitioners and distracts them from the actual reality of combat, which is simple and direct. Instead of going immediately to the heart of things, flowery forms (organized despair) and artificial techniques are ritualistically practiced to simulate actual combat. Thus, instead of “being” in combat these practitioners are “doing” something “about” combat.
* When you get down to it, real combat is not fixed and is very much “alive.” The fancy mess (a form of paralysis) solidifies and conditions what was once fluid, and when you look at it realistically, it is nothing but a blind devotion to the systematic uselessness of practicing routines or stunts that lead nowhere.
* The fighter is to always be single-minded with one object in view—to fight, looking neither backward nor sideways. He must get rid of obstructions to his forward movement, emotionally, physically or intellectually.

## **Patterns and systems**

* Set patterns, incapable of adaptability, of pliability, only offer a better cage. Truth is outside of all patterns.
* One can function freely and totally if he is “beyond the system.” The man who is really serious, with the urge to find out what truth is, has no style at all. He lives only in what is.

## **Total comprehension**

* The height of cultivation runs to simplicity. Half-way cultivation runs to ornamentation.
* We shall find the truth when we examine the problem. The problem is never apart from the answer. The problem is the answer — understanding the problem dissolves the problem.
* Awareness has no frontier; it is a giving of your whole being, without exclusion. Concentration is a narrowing down of the mind. But we are concerned with the total process of living and to concentrate exclusively on any particular aspect of life, belittles life.
* When you partially understand something, you make everything more complicated and add the extraneous.
