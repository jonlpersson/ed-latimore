  Hairmetto Topical Saw Palmetto is an all-natural alternative to topical
  finasteride+minoxidil solutions on the market. I've been using it in my hair
  loss stack for over a year.

Hairmetto Hair Serum For Hair Loss is an all-natural solution hair loss treatment for men who want fuller hair and combat hair loss without:

* Disrupting their hormones by taking finasteride
* Spending the money on low-level laser therapy, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or a hair transplant
* Enduring the discomfort of derma rolling/micro needling
* Gambling on organic solutions that aren't backed up by scientific research

It's been part of my hair loss prevention and retention protocol for about 2 years. I started using it after my FUE hair transplant to keep the hair that wasn't transplanted and to increase the hair density of the hairs that weren't transplanted.

There are many ways to tackle male pattern baldness, such as surgery and medication, but most people don't know about this hair regrowth product or how it works. The best part is that it's simple and has no drug-related side effects, mainly because it's not a drug.
