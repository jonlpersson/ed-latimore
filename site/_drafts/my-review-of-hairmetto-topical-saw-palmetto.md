Hairmetto Hair Serum For Hair Loss is an all-natural solution hair loss treatment for men who want fuller hair and combat hair loss without:

* Disrupting their hormones by taking finasteride
* Spending the money on low-level laser therapy, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or a hair transplant
* Enduring the discomfort of derma rolling/micro needling
* Gambling on organic solutions that aren't backed up by scientific research

It's been part of my hair loss prevention and retention protocol for about 2 years. I started using it after my FUE hair transplant to keep the hair that wasn't transplanted and to increase the hair density of the hairs that weren't transplanted.

There are many ways to tackle male pattern baldness, such as surgery and medication, but most people don't know about this hair regrowth product or how it works. The best part is that it's simple and has no drug-related side effects, mainly because it's not a drug

## Product details: Natural ingredients in Hairmetto

The natural ingredients are:

* Saw Palmetto
* Pumpkin Seed Oil
* Castor Oil
* Stinging Nettle
* Rosemary
* Lavender
* Cedarwood

These ingredients have been clinically studied and proven to regrow and replenish hair ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7648777/)). This botanical formula combines to create a potent, natural, anti-inflammatory hair follicle oil DHT blocker. I also like the smell, but that's neither here nor there.

Herbal formulations today have become more attractive because of some particular advantages over a novel drug administration system and dosage form. The herbs are naturally occurring, so they produce fewer side effects and toxicity than synthetic carriers for alopecia treatment.

This is significant because although the most comparable product is topical finasteride+minoxidil. That competitor is topical and much safe, but it's still not something you should have around pregnant women, and it can have smaller—albeit less severe—side effects.

Let's dig into these powerful ingredients and why this product is a potent weapon in your fight to reduce hair loss.&nbsp;

### Topical Saw Palmetto

Saw palmetto is a plant native to North America that grows in swamps and marshes. It was used traditionally in folk medicine to treat urinary tract infections, prostate problems, and other conditions. Today, saw palmetto is commonly used to treat symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate gland, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and erectile dysfunction.

Saw Palmetto is also a natural remedy for hair loss because it's a powerful, competitive, non-selective inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase. This means it has the same DHT-reducing power as Propecia (finasteride). Saw Palmetto blocks the nuclear uptake of DHT in target cells and decreases DHT binding to androgen receptors by approximately 50%. Because it is naturally occurring, it doesn't have side effects of the same severity as finasteride ([Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26010505/)). Side effects are rare and light, mainly **headache, nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness.**

### Pumpkin Seed Oil

Pumpkin seed oil comes from the seeds of the pumpkin plant. It contains high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, including linoleic acid, an essential omega-6 fatty acid. It also contains beta-sitosterol, which has inhibitory effects on the 5α-reductase enzyme ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6823528/#B3)). Linoleic acid also has inhibitory activity against 5α-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrogen testosterone (DHT).

Linoleic acid helps maintain healthy skin and hair follicles and improves blood circulation. It also reduces inflammation and swelling, making it useful for treating acne and psoriasis. This is due to its antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytoprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties.&nbsp;

Oral administration of 400 mg of pumpkin seed oil has been shown to regrow hair.&nbsp; Along with inhibiting the effect of 5-alpha-reductase, pumpkin seed oil has been shown to inhibit the number of hair follicles in the telogen phase and increase the ones in the anagen phase.&nbsp;

Pumpkin seed oil is also a fantastic DHT blocker. It inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which causes hair loss. In fact, it's one of the strongest inhibitors of DHT ever tested.

### Castor Oil

Castor oil is derived from the castor bean plant. As a little piece of random trivia, castor beans are poisonous due to the high level of ricin found in the plant. However, castor oil is not poisonous because the extraction process uses such high heat that the poison is denatured and inactivated.

The data-driven studies on castor oil are somewhat inconclusive, but the anecdotal evidence is strong. After investigating it myself, I found castor oil seems to work by attacking the non-DHT-related causes of hair loss, mainly as an antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fungal agent.&nbsp;

It's rich in ricinoleic acid, which has been shown to improve hair growth and prevent hair loss. It reduces inflammation, allows blood to flow to the hair root, and delivers nutrients. Ricinoleic acid is also a potent prostaglandin D2 inhibitor. This hormone-like substance is elevated in men suffering from male pattern baldness ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3982925/)).

### Stinging Nettle

Nettles are members of the nettle family, Urticaceae. They contain saponins, which have mild antiseptic properties.

Nettles contain a compound called sesquiterpene lactones, or SLs. These compounds have been known to effectively prevented hair loss since the 1970s ([Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29808617/)). The active ingredient in nettles is called allantoin, and it's thought to stimulate hair growth by increasing nitric oxide production.&nbsp;

Allantoin also works as a keratinocyte activator, promoting the proliferation of cells that make up your hair follicle. Allantoin also has anti-inflammatory properties, so it can help reduce redness and irritation caused by dandruff and other conditions.&nbsp;

### Rosemary

Rosemary is at least as effective as a 2% minoxidil solution for regrowing hair ([Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/)). It also motivates healthy hair growth by improving blood circulation and vascularity, helping the regeneration of follicles similar effect that is shown by minoxidil.

If Rosemary is taken orally, it's safe at low doses. However, higher doses can cause coma, muscle spasms, vomiting, and miscarriage; therefore, pregnant women should avoid using rosemary products. Because Hairmetto is a topical solution, you avoid these medical conditions.&nbsp;

### Lavender

Lavender has been tested on the hair follicles of mice and has been shown to significantly increased the number of hair follicles, deepened hair follicle depth, and thickened the dermal layer ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843973/)).

### Cedarwood

Cedarwood gives the oil a nice smell but is also functional.&nbsp;

This is the only ingredient on the list that does not have a scientific study behind it. What I found out about it is that it works by increasing circulation to the scalp, which is never a bad thing.&nbsp;

## How I use Hairmetto&nbsp;

I apply Hairmetto on the days I use my derma roller because it doesn't aggravate the fresh puncture wounds from the roller. Normally I use my finasteride + minoxidil spray, but on the mornings that use the derma roller, I prefer to use Hairmetto because it doesn't have alcohol, so it doesn't sting.

It's easy to go overboard the first time you use the Harimetto oil because you have to get a feel for how much it expands. It has a great cedarwood smell, but it is oily. If you use it before you go to bed at night, don't be surprised if you get oil stains on your pillowcase. I'd imagine this is why it's primarily recommended for daytime wear.&nbsp;

If the oil is a big deal, there is also an anti-hair loss serum. I've never used it, but the ingredient profile gives me no reason to think it wouldn't work.&nbsp;
