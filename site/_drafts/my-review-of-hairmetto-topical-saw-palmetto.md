Hairmetto Hair Serum For Hair Loss is an all-natural solution hair loss treatment for men who want fuller hair and combat hair loss without:

* Disrupting their hormones by taking finasteride
* Spending the money on low-level laser therapy, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or a hair transplant
* Enduring the discomfort of derma rolling/micro needling
* Gambling on organic solutions that aren't backed up by scientific research

It's been part of my hair loss prevention and retention protocol for about 2 years. I started using it after my FUE hair transplant to keep the hair that wasn't transplanted and to increase the hair density of the hairs that weren't transplanted.

There are many ways to tackle male pattern baldness, such as surgery and medication, but most people don't know about this hair regrowth product or how it works. The best part is that it's simple and has no drug-related side effects, mainly because it's not a drug

## Product details: Natural ingredients in Hairmetto

The natural ingredients are:

* Saw Palmetto
* Pumpkin Seed Oil
* Castor Oil
* Stinging Nettle
* Rosemary
* Lavender
* Cedarwood

These ingredients have been clinically studied and proven to regrow and replenish hair ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7648777/)). This botanical formula combines to create a potent, natural, anti-inflammatory hair follicle oil DHT blocker. I also like the smell, but that's neither here nor there.

Herbal formulations today have become more attractive because of some particular advantages over a novel drug administration system and dosage form. The herbs are naturally occurring, so they produce fewer side effects and toxicity than synthetic carriers for alopecia treatment.

This is significant because although the most comparable product is topical finasteride+minoxidil. That competitor is topical and much safe, but it's still not something you should have around pregnant women, and it can have smaller—albeit less severe—side effects.

Let's dig into these powerful ingredients and why this product is a potent weapon in your fight to reduce hair loss.&nbsp;
