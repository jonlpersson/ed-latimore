My website, visual identity, brand messaging, content strategy, and the brand strategy that underpins them, were all created with the help of [Jon from CultMethod](https://cultmethod.com).

I have worked with Jon since 2017 and without his help, I wouldn't be where I am today. Everyone should have a Jon.

If you need help taking your brand to the next level (whether you're a writer like me or run a more traditional business), reach out to Jon. And do check out [the case study](https://cultmethod.com/work/ed-latimore/) he wrote about this project, to get an idea of the breadth and depth of his expertise.
