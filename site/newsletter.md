      Ed's newsletter is the only one I've been subscribed to for over 7 years.
      It's the only one of its kind that doesn't feel formulaic, repetitive, or
      generic. Anyone who wants to improve their thinking and actions should
      sign up and never look back.

      Welcome to the Stoic Street Smarts newsletter, where I share the
      hard-fought wisdom I’ve gained from a life that’s taken me from the hood
      to the boxing ring, from the army to the halls of academia.


      * The streets taught me how to read people

      * Sobriety showed me the power of keeping it real with myself.

      * Boxing developed my discipline and resilience

      * The military taught me teamwork

      * Physics helps me master complexity


      I share practical insights from these diverse experiences to help you
      cultivate the mental toughness, emotional intelligence, and strategic
      thinking needed to thrive in an unpredictable world.

      I've been a subscriber to Ed Latimore's newsletter for years and have been
      an avid reader throughout. In an online world with a lot of the same old
      boring stuff, his writing makes me think and has given me plenty of
      "ah-ha's" for my business&nbsp; I highly recommend it!

      - heading: Build relationships
        text: >-
          People are the most important thing. Learn how to build
          non-transactional relationships that will pay off WAY more than any
          quid-por-quo, tit-for-tat, cheesy networking style of interaction.
      - heading: Face reality
        text: >-
          You can't fix problems if you're not willing to face them, and life is
          one big series of problems. If you never learn to overcome, you'll
          always be overcome.
