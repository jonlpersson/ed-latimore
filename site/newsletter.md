          People are the most important thing. Learn how to build

        text: >-
          You can't fix problems if you're not willing to face them, and life is

      "Ed's newsletter is the only one I've been subscribed to for over 7 years.
      It's the only one of its kind that doesn't feel formulaic, repetitive, or
      generic. Anyone who wants to improve their thinking and actions should
      sign up and never look back."&nbsp;
